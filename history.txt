GroupMe  ----->  David Busby added Amanda Mesiarik Davidson, Taylor Pruitt, Keaton Rhea, Daniel R, Cindy R, and 4 others to the group.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Is this where the cool kids hang...lol
David Busby  ----->  Ok guys so the idea of admins and such were thrown around. Amanda and I have been talking and we think this is the best solution for right now
David Busby  ----->  You can either love or hate Amanda for the name 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Her and the damn alliteration 
Darren May  ----->  I’m fine with talking to kentoo and adding him if that it was the group wants. Maybe a trial basis once he hits 30?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Just to make sure we’re all on the same page here...what is this group going to be used for? Votes? Raids? Matters of national security?
Amanda  ----->  Matters of national security of course. 
David Busby  ----->  I’d say votes on what needs to happen with mystic chat
David Busby  ----->  And a place for me to question why Leslie posts what she does 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Cool. I see one logistical issue...we have an even number of people. I’ll exclude myself from votes and just weigh in on things since I’m just an *honorary* member of this group
Amanda  ----->  We need to know where the Aron’s are!
David Busby  ----->  What about the sevipers and scythers?
Amanda  ----->  Who’s opinion is strongly valued.
Darren May  ----->  Y’all are so bad. However I’m pretty sure that’s what ken will be like except higher volume
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Hey @David Busby my alt still needs a seviper....
David Busby  ----->  I would also like to bring up adding Matt baker. He asked me to add him a while back and I’ve just been ignoring it. I do not want to add him and have him go off looking for some random beldum i posted at 1230am 
David Busby  ----->  But at the same time I feel like a dick
Darren May  ----->  What’s wrong with matt baker? Who is matt baker?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Heavy is the head that wears the crown...
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Or in this case whatever this ten-headed mutant is
David Busby  ----->  He’s on the spectrum I’m pretty sure 
Cindy R  ----->  I'll be honest I can get along with pretty much anyone, BUT with that being said I have my notifications off unless I am tagged in something.  Soo, with that being said I can see how the crazy posts are irritating.   
Cindy R  ----->  But I am like Amanda, let's just be a big happy family...lol

We can always disown the weird cousin later.
Darren May  ----->  We should probably just have a standard for admittance. Presumably level 30 and your main account is mystic. Then I would suggest one of the MMs serve as a mentor to a new admittee or maybe just the questionable new admitees. 1 warning from your mentor and your out if you screw up again 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I will mentor huckleberry to the best of my ability although he has already been warned that he better not get another 98 IV or shinny from a raid before I do.
David Busby  ----->  I’d be ok with that but at the same time we need to purge mystic chat bad. Several times I’ve seen names idk add other people idk 
Cindy R  ----->  
I do agree with that.  At this point who knows what the other teams are seeing. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  *not just main account being 30. Otherwise we’re opening up to the JimmiStorms of the entire community 
David Busby  ----->  Oh that is understood
Amanda  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt Avatar...
GroupMe  ----->  David Busby changed the group's avatar
David Busby  ----->  Sorry meant to do that earlier 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  After this community day I feel like the level should be 35 for admittance with case by case exceptions for those that contribute but are lower level (whether they’re new or just semi-casuals that take gyms often). Phil is a perfect example of a lower level that is a great addition. But after this double xp event, raids on raids on raids for the last 6 months, and 3x xp on community day, we have to set the bar a little higher and give people something to work toward I think
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I guarantee that if we removed half the users from the group they would never even have an opportunity to ask us why they were booted because they would never actually see us to have the chance to ask
David Busby  ----->  It kinda depends whether we go full on storm or not. I’m ok with keeping level 30+ but I’d really like to prune out the people in the group that i don’t even know. 
David Busby  ----->  Also I added Ian and Michelle to the group so they could decide who is worthwhile to keep in the group for on campus. Most of those players are sub 35 but at least will go after the on campus spawns we post
Darren May  ----->  Yeah I definitely meant that the person has to primarily play as mystic which would rule out jimmi and others. I think 35 is a good threshold with special consideration for those under 35 who make strong contributions (gyms, raids or community days).
Darren May  ----->  Also I say if there is someone in the main mystic group that none of us can vouch for, we remove. Let them ask to be brought back in if they’re still playing. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Alright well I’m going to start from the top and go ahead and throw a few names out here to see if anyone knows who they are or wants them to stay:

Alex, Adam Creel, Alexander Calvert, Andrew Wang, Austin Nash, Bailey Nicole Martin (I know who she is but she hasn’t played or said anything in 6 months), Bea Timms, Brandon Lane, Bunk bunk, Caroline McCrary, Cesar Sanchez (pyrorower), Chris Griffin.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'll have to check with Cindy but i thought Adam creel is an instinct I've seen in tallassee.
Amanda  ----->  Isn’t Alex the tall tossled hair Alex that called out the 💯magikarp at the end of October. I forget his trainer name...I haven’t seen him that much this semester, or is that Alex Jester from the big group...
Darren May  ----->  I’ve raided with Alex recently so I would say keep him. The rest I don’t know or haven’t heard from in months
Cindy R  ----->  Pretty sure that is correct about Adam creel.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If it is alex tate, then I have also done raids with him before. He is semi-casual on campus but was at the first mewtwo beta
Sam Kawell  ----->  I've done some raids with Caesar Sanchez around a month ago. He seemed pretty casual and I haven't seen him do anything since.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I think the last time I saw Cesar was in 2017, but he used to be really active. Took the bike shop a lot back when it was a gym. We’ll leave him in for now
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Alex as well
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Wave 2:

Claire Heacox, Daisy Griffin, Ellie Williamson, Elliot, Emma Haywood, Faith Anderson, Haley Mcabee, Jackson Moss, Jennifer, Jeremy P, Jonathan, Jonathan 2, Joseph Scott, Joseph Speake

Guys...who are these people? How did our group get here?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive seen claire post b4. Don't know anything about them. Elliot is a student ive done a raid with. Very casual and does not play much anymore. I also thought he or maybe the guy he played with was valor.... But I could b wrong
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Don't know any of the other names at all
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I recognized Claire’s name as well but wasn’t sure when or where I had seen her post. She can stay 👍🏼
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive not seen elliot in a long time tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He might of quit
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Elliott is in the big group so if he just occasionally raids he’ll be fine just being in there. If he gets active again and wants to be added back we will
Amanda  ----->  Elliott played with yay4dj but is Mystic. 
Darren May  ----->  Just realized that I think I go to church with Caroline McCrary and Ellie Williamson. Never actually seen them play though so I would vote for removal 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  So far we’re keeping Alex, Cesar, and Claire from the ones posted. About to go to round three...@Ian Fraser @Michelle U  do you want to save any of the other people above or no?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Never seen any of those names.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt i think to many people have trusted......unnamed individuals... with there phones. @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson And no I'm not talking about that fluk but I'm nnow it sure If some Opelika mystic players have.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Maybe flook....flock....i don't know....didnt like English class
Amanda  ----->  Lol. I know. We have a good bit of inactive players that need cleaned up, but I do want to be inclusive of active players.
Amanda  ----->  It’s fluke though...lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Auto correct just doesn't understand me...lol.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Alright on to wave 3:

Kelly Burnham, Ken mc, Kevin, Kimberly Bagley, Nathan, Nathan Kling, Ryan Cook, Sarah H, Sarah stoner Doyle (recognize her but don’t know when the last time I saw her was), Skyler Krantz, Spencer, Tanner Hunter, Thomas

That’s it. Also I’m removing J Lau because of his family’s absurd multi accounting
Sam Kawell  ----->  Kelly Burnham is a 31 mystic who is an Aerospace undergrad. I know her well.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Kelly stays 👍🏼
Sam Kawell  ----->  And Ryan cook rings a bell, but I can't quite place where I've heard it.
Amanda  ----->  420burnham. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Ahhhh
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Should’ve put that together
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Doesn’t Anthony play for her?
Amanda  ----->  Sarah is bug catchersara 
Amanda  ----->  Doesn’t play anymore 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Or maybe that was just on community day or something idk
Amanda  ----->  I think he plays for her on occasion. Definitely community day
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Sam Kawell I'm picturing a Ryan haven't seen him much lately. Comments about he's working late all the time. Usually blue, maybe mechanics shirt and boots?
Amanda  ----->  Juice box
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Daniel R That’s Ryan Martin aka juice box 
Darren May  ----->  I also go to church with skyler krantz but I’ve never seen him play. Learning a lot today
Darren May  ----->  Don’t know any of the rest
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Bailey Nicole Martin from wave 1 is his wife but I’ve only seen her show up to like two raids with him and it’s been a long time. I think keeping him in will be enough
Sam Kawell  ----->  I totally didn't know there was a connection between burnham and Pseudo. Is that reason enough to kick her out, though? Honest question
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Sam Kawell I wasn’t suggesting kicking her, I just thought it was curious
Amanda  ----->  I’m learning that you, snookems and the father should have won the costume contest if you go to church with that many Pokémon players. It was rigged
Sam Kawell  ----->  And I don't think I have actually seen Ryan, just his comments now the I think of that.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  But it is something to consider I guess
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I’ve raided with Ryan a decent bit, he’s not a strong player but he’s around a couple nights a week
Darren May  ----->  There is not a lot of interaction between students and residents so that’s why I have to look at their names closely. The judges at the contest were old people who didn’t get it. Not that I’m still bitter or anything 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Sam Kawell that may explain some things. More than once I got shaved out of a gym and 420burnham put in. Places like TC and bowdin.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I think there is a point where someone can be too connected with another team. We want this mystic GroupMe for the mystics after all
Sam Kawell  ----->  But that might be a dangerous thing to say.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Cause Darren might fall under that category, but noone would question his loyalty to mystic
Amanda  ----->  Well... I’m guilty too
Darren May  ----->  IMHO we should treat shaving like spoofing. Otherwise it is ok to be friends with the other guys
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im guilty too I guess. I work like 10ft away from chase aka hambot. But we dont shave. Just raid and hundo hunt
Amanda  ----->  Snookems is the true Instinct no leash.
Amanda  ----->  Maverick has nothing on him
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Darren May Not going to lie I was absolutely terrified to think about having snookems phone used for my Mewtwo raid. Didn’t want to become a level 39 water trainer....
Darren May  ----->  I’ve got that out of him. He was disappointed that he didn’t get to raid for anyone though
David Busby  ----->  Is Joseph Scott the dude that runs around with bigbadbrad also I swear I recognize the name jackson moss 
Amanda  ----->  The shaving junk is for the birds.
Amanda  ----->  Mamagergz 😡
Amanda  ----->  If you could’ve seen how close I was to gold on Cary when Mystic held it for a week straight and I wasn’t in it...🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️I’ll get gold later.
Amanda  ----->  Which I already have
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @David Busby No idea about Joseph but unless you have anything more concrete on both of them I’m going to kick them. If anyone is active and gets kicked it’ll work itself out bc someone will say something - either them or another in the group
David Busby  ----->  I’m down with it. Commence the kicking. I’m popping my popcorn 
Amanda  ----->  Start with disclaimer 
Darren May  ----->  We would have to be relatively sure of shaving though. I would give people the benefit of the doubt since so many weird things can happen. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The only Joseph I know is war eagle joe. But he might have a diff name in the group
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok double checked, he is listed as  wareaglejoe in mystic chat
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not the same one. 
David Busby  ----->  I’ve never seen Joseph Scotty post but when bigbadbrad runs around town on the weekends he usually has an account named jscotty with him. Never seen him post in mystic. Only very occasionally posts in big group. If he wants back in he can get brad to vouch for him
David Busby  ----->  Wait hold up we might need to add Chris griffin back. That’s rube203 right?
David Busby  ----->  Grace Tatum, hutchdogmar, and Hannah Anderson. Don’t recognize any of those 
Amanda  ----->  Hutch is Debbie’s son hasn’t later in forever
Amanda  ----->  Grace doesn’t play either
Sam Kawell  ----->  Does anyone know John Whitten?
David Busby  ----->  Nope
Amanda  ----->  Haven’t seen him raid in forever, but he would be in a silver suv with mom or dad I think
Amanda  ----->  I wish trainer names were next to real name.
David Busby  ----->  Don’t know Jonathan carpenter either. And we’ve got three Matt’s and I only know one. I know one has to be mattdaddy who I’ve only met once but know he used to be active 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I recognized Grace’s name but not sure where from. Johnathan Carpenter is Philomathematic, one of the OG mystic powerhouses. Not as active anymore, but still shows up from time to time. Matt daddy is Matt Morgan. I know Matthew Bell posts a lot and tries to get your spawn posts. Matt Hall I recognized but I think it’s been forever since he’s posted or since I’ve seen him
David Busby  ----->  Is that who philothematic is?? Yea he was still out when I was getting back in. Weird dude. Don’t think I ever saw him wear shoes 
Amanda  ----->  Grace was the blonde with glasses that raised a good bit in the summer with her boyfriend. 
David Busby  ----->  One would be at the museum for every raid?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Yeah him and JM (Darth Eokoles) and Hannah Anderson used to be some of the main Mystics before the gym rework. Left them in out of legacy but Hannah is mostly opelika and doesn’t play much anymore I don’t think, and JM only occasionally pops up around Cary
David Busby  ----->  Who’s the mindy person?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  For those of you unaware....this is where it all began 😬
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well the reason I ask about John Whitten is that I've never seen him post in mystic group and the only time I saw him do anything in the main chat was change his name to Pseudothrax when Anthony got kicked. I'm sure that's nothing, but it made me suspicious.
Darren May  ----->  John whitten is roommates with Isaac Johnson. They use to take Zion and Boykin a lot
Amanda  ----->  Bingo!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Gotcha. I know Isaac
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I don't even see Isaac anymore. Just once late night about a month ago 
David Busby  ----->  Ok question, why do so many storm and valor hate Isaac?
Amanda  ----->  No deals. Ruthless with gyms when he is doing them. 
Darren May  ----->  Ha I was going to say he battles gyms like an instinct 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Glad I'm not like that 
Amanda  ----->  Felton 1040 Ray
Michelle U  ----->  Sorry Taylor just now woke up and saw your tag XD I didn't recognize most of those names. Pretty sure Ryan cook is rcook. Him and his gf FaithMichelle throw on campus gyms sometimes but haven't seen at raids in a while
Cindy R  ----->  Whew...just trying to catch up myself.  I don't recognize those either.  And @Michelle U  I don't think our paths have actually crossed yet!  Lol
Cindy R  ----->  How is that even possible...lol
Michelle U  ----->  Lol! Yes I don't think we've met, but it's probably because I usually only stick to daytime campus raids
Cindy R  ----->  Yea, we are pretty much just evening. 
Michelle U  ----->  Yeah there isn't too much overlap between campus players v off campus. I'm hoping once school let's up we'll have more time to raid off campus 😊
Cindy R  ----->  T5 at stadium in 53 mins
Cindy R  ----->  I'm a softy...LOL. 
Cindy R  ----->  @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson a major close are you?
Amanda  ----->  Turning at stadium
Michelle U  ----->  I'll let you guys at haley
Michelle U  ----->  *meet
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Cindy R Let’s keep the raid and normal chat in the main mystic group so everyone is still included in it! This group will probably go silent for long periods of time unless we have something to discuss that needs to be private 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Cindy R You guys are parking and coming to Parker right? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh wrong chat 
Ian Fraser  ----->  We need different icons lol
GroupMe  ----->  Taylor Pruitt changed the group's avatar
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  How’s that?
Cindy R  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt tseveral of us were standing at the raid and this guy asked if there was a mystic chat...I felt so bad when Darren asked his level and was like, yep almost there..LOL. 
David Busby  ----->  That’s the Matt baker dude
Darren May  ----->  Matt or kentoo. Who would you pick @David Busby ?
David Busby  ----->  If I absolutely had to pick kentoo because I’m genuinely concerned I’ll get Matt in trouble going after a spawn I post 
Amanda  ----->  Can’t we let them both!
David Busby  ----->  Do we actually wanna vote on it?
Darren May  ----->  Well technically if we agree on 35 we don’t have to vote yet
David Busby  ----->  I’m gonna gone with that lol 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I agree on 35 and that they’re not an exception case
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think 35 is a bit steep. I think we should be somewhat exclusive, but 35 would keep good players away. 
Amanda  ----->  I want to be inclusive with active Mystic players.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I think we should focus on including active players and keeping out alt accounts. I know many people who fall under those who are under 35
Ian Fraser  ----->  Agree on that. I only hit 35 a couple weeks ago. Same with Michelle. And most Pharmacy are lower.
Michelle U  ----->  If it was limited to 35, it'd probably be as big as this current Groupme XD I agree with 30+
Darren May  ----->  35 is steep but it is pretty easy at this point for people to take an alt to 30.  Most of the people in the group now under 35 you could easily point to gym or raid participation 
Cindy R  ----->  I do like the thought of being inclusive, but I will say we started our alt Mystic account in January and he hit level 33 today.  So we would need to be careful who we add..with name changes and new people in the area it would be easy for someone to get added thats not truly mystic. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, i don't think any level will be a way to stop alt accounts. We will need some different method to stop them. I don't have any suggestions, but I know that a base level won't stop them.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I think this group voting would be a decent way to do it 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes group voting + meeting in person
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  If only one person meets them then that person can make it known to the group, and if that person starts to contribute they can be added. I think in general adding new people on the spot would be a bad idea unless it’s someone we’ve seen around like QuestionY2k
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Also keep in mind there’s a group solely dedicated to raids so just seeing them around at the raids from time to time probably wouldn’t be a reason to add them to mystic chat unless they are involved in gyms or want to hunt spawns 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I was off!  Sorry didnt think it thru haha
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Or want to contribute to others gameplay with analysis and important insight like Sam always has
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I will say I know my pokemon. Type chart, stats, etc. But sam puts me to shame eith number crunch!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Numbers not the same in PoGo
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Of course you contribute as much as anyone!
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Your Poke knowledge is unrivaled in auburn from what I’ve seen
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha im sure there are others on par!
Sam Kawell  ----->  I do think you know your pokes better than me, but I was a math major, so...
Cindy R  ----->  I will say you guys put me to shame...LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im an electrical engineer... So I like maths but im also lazy at times haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I know garchomp is coming, gonna b best non legend dragon. Zekrom will b a beast electric. Rheshiom (sp?) Is legit. Dialga and palkia dragons coming. Steel water, respectively!  Gen 6 gonna have yvetal (only thing that can out class ttar) and xterneas (best fairy by far)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, big one. Concldurr will out class champ. He is better sadly. So oogly
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Conkldurr
Darren May  ----->  Gen 1 & 2are the best. Grumble grumble grumble 
David Busby  ----->  I know 1-3 and 7 plus what’s in 4-6 that are in 7
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like all gens. Sorry but I disagree. I never grew up haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I had to hide it from ppl all thru middle school and high school. Not acceptable. I did not get mt first game until I was like 7 or 8 when it was cool
Darren May  ----->  I got yellow and the special edition pikachu game boy color when I was 13. Played it non-stop. I actually bought the Japanese version of silver so I could play it sooner. I had a video game magazine with common Japanese phrases so I thought I could figure it out. Spoiler alert: I could not. I did beat Falkner though
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Keldo mythic eater fighting is also coming soon with terrikan.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mythic water fighting**
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was stupid child darren. I beat blue eith my lvl 70 something charizard bc I didnt know how to change poke battle order haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gold I had a full team of lvl 100s. I remember jolteon, dnite, scizor, umbreon, alakazam, ttar.
Darren May  ----->  My brother had his level 80 Blastoise
Darren May  ----->  It was easier to power through with your starter than balance your team
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes agreed. Except for that battle vs brock.... I had to get to lvl 15+ or so b4 I could beat his rock pokes. I remember it was a grind for me... Then again for misty haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was soooo bad
David Busby  ----->  Brock was easy if you got that double kick nidoran!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I did not know how to switch starting pokes.... I was dumb as a rock
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It was charmander or die
Darren May  ----->  Confusion butterfree!
David Busby  ----->  I think I was like 5 when I got red. My mom had to ask someone how to get out of pallet town. I didn’t know you could go into the grass
Darren May  ----->  In leaf green charmander gets a steel move around level 12 and wrecks them
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes iron claw!!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wait....metal claw! American name haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I apologize in advance, but I will b mia starting tomorrow. Carroll has surgery in the morning plus im dog sitting luna! Im gonna be on care giver duty 24/7
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt i was thinking something similar. If the public mystic group is chit chat and raid chat or whatever, would we just use this chat for gym spots/perfect pokes? I'm still not trying to exclude anyone but not everyone has the same goals. 
David Busby  ----->  I think this chat might be more useful as an oversight committee or making decisions about who needs to be in or out. Or what me Darren and Keaton are doing and reminiscing lol 
David Busby  ----->  Or calling out the really rare spawns
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Darren May 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  (As I post a non related picture) I think this group should be strictly for oversight and voting on certain players or the direction of the mystics in auburn. Anything related to gyms, spawns, or general game tactics should stay in main mystic chat so all can learn and benefit 
David Busby  ----->  I will also be using this group to point out whenever anyone says anything particularly stupid in mystic chat
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  So this guy dm’d me asking me to unpurge him. Forgot he had sent me this from when we were tracking goal post raids, but I have never seen him post or raid other than this. I asked if he plays in auburn and he hasn’t answered me. Do we add him back?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wait and see his response! High lvl but I dont like cheaters
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I've never seen them before
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive seen him but I think it was on campus. I could b wrong but that name is familiar
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is an awful team for a lvl 36 tho.
Amanda  ----->  So....Matt Baker is lvl 30 now. I’m a softy on this one and am going to add him...speak now or forever hold your peace.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My vote. Take it as you will on how active I am on the topic.
Darren May  ----->  @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson  are you going to be his mentor?
Amanda  ----->  🙋🏻‍♀️I volunteer as tribute 🤷🏻‍♀️
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I’ll just ignore him if he’s saying things I don’t care about 
Darren May  ----->  I fine with it. I just hope you don’t take on too much when you become Kenton’s mentor as well 😂
Darren May  ----->  I’m fine with it.My typing is very bad today
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Did I fuse with kentoo? Made kenton??
Darren May  ----->  Jeez. Kentoo 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm cool with that too.
Darren May  ----->  Hey I’m watching cars with the family 
David Busby  ----->  When Matt bakers grandmother is asking me why he left the house at 1am for a beldum you get to answer why @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I aint monitoring kentoo.... Amanda will save us all!
Amanda  ----->  I feel like I can wooo g-ma.
Darren May  ----->  Realistically how many do you post after midnight?
David Busby  ----->  Hey I’m just trying to be a good person. You also don’t remember him asking where the ttar raid was at 11pm that one night raid chat was going off
Darren May  ----->  Hey I keep that muted for a reason.
Amanda  ----->  Didn’t want to give you time to change your minds. @Taylor Pruitt Dude just ignore 😁
Amanda  ----->  I tagged the wrong Matt😱😱😱I’ve got fat fingers🤷🏻‍♀️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I saw that haha
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Opinions? Sounds like a raid group candidate to me
David Busby  ----->  I’m ok with it. We have worse in there 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes if he is legit
Sam Kawell  ----->  Same here
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Give him a go and we will find out real quick!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just for confirmation 
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby With no chill for kentoo 
David Busby  ----->  I’ll be the bad guy if I have to 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Well he’s still level 28 and we don’t want someone randomly adding him at a raid so I’m glad you gave a hard no
David Busby  ----->  I don’t want him in there even if he’s 30+...
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't think that finding him annoying is a good enough reason to not accept him when he gets to 30, though...
Amanda  ----->  Agreed.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I agree. But only if we prevent it from being a similar situation to what happened with adriana and storm
Darren May  ----->  What happened with Adriana and the storm?
Amanda  ----->  Well...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She is gullible and opens herself up to b the butt of Every joke. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like unknowns at Wal-Mart
Amanda  ----->  They used to mess with her in their chat. She left. She was in Opelika chat calling Storm douches and Jas added Matt then Matt kicked her and left...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mystics should b better than that
Cindy R  ----->  The good thing is don't think I have encountered anyone in our group that picks on anyone like that.  
Amanda  ----->  But what Keaton said is it too, and she can’t laugh at herself I guess. You have to be able to be the butt of a joke and laugh with everyone else at yourself sometimes, but Some people cross lines...
Amanda  ----->  *cough cough yellow folks
Darren May  ----->  Well if I’m being optimistic there is a good opportunity to educate kentoo and mold him into a contributing member of the team. I’m confident that is possible with his very capable mentor, @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson. Once he hits 30 of course
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson You’ll be the one responsible for helping him out with those T2s
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  😬
Amanda  ----->  As long as it’s a Mawile 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Being able to solo all T2s would be an easy additional criteria for entry
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would b surprised if he couldn't solo a mawile now. Assuming he picks right mons. He should have enough lvl 20 legendary to do it
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well that can be wonky just because of the rotation and ones like Cloyster that are far more difficult to solo. Just imagine if they introduced Shuckle as a tier two 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  As long as we tell him which ones are impossible and help him select his team, I do not see a problem. We want him to learn
David Busby  ----->  Well if we’re letting him in can we also stipulate that he’s gotta stop dropping all three accounts in angym
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes, we have time. Lvl 30 is his requirements for now I think
Darren May  ----->  Well multiaccounting would have to be one of the etiquette pieces we teach him, although it is pretty blurry.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, one could argue Cindy and Daniel do a similar thing with huckleberry
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  True and we have asked multiple times about putting alt in on campus to be curtious.  No one ever commented. So if we take a gym and it doesn't fill up, next time we put alt account in. Also we use alt to help berry everyone.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I don't have a problem with it, but he might call double standard if we don't let him do the same thing.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I find it hard to try and tell him not to multi drop because I put trash pokes in gyms a lot. My trash > most people’s trash but still, not much different than his alts
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm on the fence about alts all together. We leave space and then gets filled with Pete's pidgies or any others teams trash accounts.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Not to leave out the we have mystic that do the same thing. Show up for a raid, see we have 5 people and decide to go in with his or her level 20 alt instinct accounts.
David Busby  ----->  These people in front of me obviously don’t understand how badly I need a perfect machamp 
Sam Kawell  ----->  (4% increase in DPS over a 5-5-5 champ)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But bragging rights for david will increase 1000000%
Sam Kawell  ----->  I guess that is a pretty significant percentage
Darren May  ----->  I mean I was pretty excited about my 💯 Machamp too until he took that first dazzling gleam to the face
David Busby  ----->  Don’t you talk bad about machamps 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Fine.....no comment
David Busby  ----->  Rip my candies
Darren May  ----->  I guess you need to rent a campsite out there
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Bet you wish you had road to Montgomery with us last month now...lol
David Busby  ----->  I know I thought I was done doing machamp raids 
Sam Kawell  ----->  You also need some hardcore stardust grinding sessions
David Busby  ----->  Oh that’s just today’s dust. It’ll be gone by tonight 
Amanda  ----->  @David Busby Did you see that threatening picture Kentoo posted for you??
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh Amanda got it...
David Busby  ----->  If it took him all day to get 1200 xp I’m not worried about it 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  In would like to take a moment to look at those notifications.... Just as bad as jin
Amanda  ----->  Matt was building up Instinct Alt to turn yellow...lol told him I enjoy raiding with him, but we can no longer chat🤷🏻‍♀️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson 6 removal
Keaton Rhea  ----->  ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Why the removal? Sorry
Amanda  ----->  Just raided with him at fire station and^^^^
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ah sorry. It loaded slow!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I trust you. Good job keeping it clean!
Amanda  ----->  No problem, and I knew you guys wouldn’t care. He’s the one that works with Garrett aka iphight 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That makes sense. I work near the darkside, but will never turn. I also started him...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Him is hambot. I ragged him for a while.
Amanda  ----->  We all got a good laugh about it at fire station. He knew it was coming🤷🏻‍♀️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :) glad it was a laugh!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think that's not bad for trash
David Busby  ----->  You take those charizards off the trash list right now. Same with venosaurs
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  The struggle to keep the bag under 1000 is real.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Bounty on any gyms Matt is in for a little while?
David Busby  ----->  If he’s gonna be this way then yes 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  What’s his alt?
David Busby  ----->  Riggitystorm
Darren May  ----->  Who is in charge of the discord and community day check in stuff now?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Lee, David, and Chase are all discord admins, so any of them can add event staff to check people in. May have to tell them how to do it and get them on the Silph discord though
David Busby  ----->  And y’all won’t be able to count on me to be there 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I will be there and can be an admin again, if someone would like to add me.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Has anyone reached out or know Chris shiflet?
David Busby  ----->  I have
David Busby  ----->  @Ian Fraser If he’s at ttar with you talk to him 
David Busby  ----->  Also has anyone ever reached out to Matt inger?
Ian Fraser  ----->  I briefly did talk to Chris. Why? 
David Busby  ----->  He 30+?
Darren May  ----->  Chris is 24 
David Busby  ----->  Just curious if he’d be worth including 
Darren May  ----->  Well if we brought him in at 24 what stops kentoo?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea not 30+
David Busby  ----->  Didn’t know he was that low 
Darren May  ----->  I’ll talk to matt inger the next time I see him. I just realized he is not the same matt we kicked out last night
David Busby  ----->  Yea that’s ingorosauros Matt. Dude puts in work 
Amanda  ----->  Just add him. I’m sure he’ll appreciate the spawn info.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Too many Matts and Jonathans and Davids
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  And Amandas
David Busby  ----->  I should just kick all the other David’s right?
Amanda  ----->  😑
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Amanda there too many because you’re the only one that matters 😉
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson 
David Busby  ----->  Ok who am I giving login to
Darren May  ----->  I’m going for it
David Busby  ----->  I think Amanda is going for it for me 
Darren May  ----->  No problem. Got to get it for Snookems too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just FYI, @Sam Kawell  is doing my EX raid this Friday. I am sure sam will tell everyone. Don't want anyone to think I was spoofing.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well we can now have you and Darren under spoofing suspicion
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dont abuse the power! Haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or abuse it. Those max revives are fine to burn on anything you see fit
Cindy R  ----->  We are going to be out of town for community day, but would love to give someone donations.  
Amanda  ----->  Am I odd for continually looking at my unown in my recents...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope. You are norman the normal
Amanda  ----->  *norma. Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol yes I failed
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I did bad in latin in HS. Feminine. Masculine. Neutered. More like I dont care what it is
David Busby  ----->  Now I wanna know if you meant to say neutral or neutered but I guess in a way neutered is neutral?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Neuter is one of them. Meaning it has not gender association. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All nouns have like 4 or 5 declination based on gender and modifier
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry I guess im a nerd. I remember things from HS when I didnt even do that well.
David Busby  ----->  That would make sense. I took French and did rather poorly. Apparently I’m very good at school except foreign languages
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im dank as skool. I hate english, but I had to learn how to spell for my papers.... Skool is kool
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Real life is hard. Bills hurt
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can learn and retain tons of useless things real fast. But that does not translate into real life
David Busby  ----->  https://dominikzen.com/ Keaton told me about this website and it my new favorite thing behind Keaton and Sam 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Not to toot my own horn too much, but my DPS calculator I posted on the mystic group does incorporate break points. 
David Busby  ----->  Link again?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah I would like to look at it again as well @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  https://poke-dpsplus.firebaseapp.com/
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What does tank values mean again? And how do I see the breakpoints?
Sam Kawell  ----->  The tank value is the attacking pokemons hp*def. I have found that it is a good charictarization of a pokemon's survivability regardless of the other pokemons moves or attack stat. 
And the website doesn't have a breakpoint calculator in it, but the DPS formula incorporates both the quick and charge breakpoints in the calculations, because it uses the floor function.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ah ok cool. It would b cool if you can integrate those breakpoints into it so ppl can see that they can get more dmg with a few power ups. I know it's a WIP
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah. I'm still trying to figure out the best way to give people info about powering up Pokemon. So far, this is better for determining ideal counters for damage balls, and deciding the best way to spend your TMs if you are creating a specialized team. 
David Busby  ----->  I like that it shows me just how abysmally bad volt switch thunder is compared to ts wc 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would also like t hat all the IVs start at 15 so I can see best case scenario
David Busby  ----->  I think that’s sams way of saying ivs don’t matter 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Whatever gives you the impression that I have that opinion @David Busby 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It really shouldn't be this difficult. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha I know they dont unless you solo or wants to do a challenge to beat something with bare min
David Busby  ----->  Who is spencer frost?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Wardamnfrost?
David Busby  ----->  Still not ringing a bell
David Busby  ----->  Well whoever wardamnfrost is he’s dropping mr mines at museum
David Busby  ----->  Jin wants to know if he’s a spoofer 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R @Daniel R parker is coming down now if you care
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There is about to b a boosted lugia raid so I doubt they will stop
Cindy R  ----->  Daniel was trying to feed.
Michelle U  ----->  Ugh I noticed too late. They're doing it one by one so I'm off already
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry @Michelle U :( I didnt realize that was you
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I should of checked who else was in there
Michelle U  ----->  Not your fault! Sam tagged us earlier so I should have been keeping a better eye on it :(
Cindy R  ----->  LOL, Daniel closed it long enough to heat up lunch.  Sorry  Michelle 😕
Sam Kawell  ----->  Sorry, having lunch with the wife
Michelle U  ----->  Lunch seems to be a vulnerable time for us 😆
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson @David Busby @Michelle U I sent a very nice email to niantec. Hope to get my pass back!
Michelle U  ----->  I hope you get it too! let us know what they say!
Sam Kawell  ----->  what happened?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I backed out to go in a later group  since michelle didnt make it in time. It said I completed the raid, gave me items, but no chance to catch
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I went in the lobby again with new ppl and it kicked me at start of battle with an error
Michelle U  ----->  he was nice enough to back out so Ian and I could join, but couldnt join second raid �
Sam Kawell  ----->  That's weird...
Michelle U  ----->  they should give you extra passes since it was boosted too!!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It must of been close to the end of the first raid when I ran, but it still should of let me catch it and not enter a new lobby
Sam Kawell  ----->  But hey, at least you got that Natu
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yup that go plus got him haha
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Can someone tell me why Ken is tagging me or if I just missed something 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yay!
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Nice!
Sam Kawell  ----->  That was quick!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was surpised how fast it was!
David Busby  ----->  Really
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt because your his hero/future sponcer...lol 
Darren May  ----->  Ok I’m cool with keeping kentoo out forever now that he has a 100 mewtwo. 🤦‍♂️ 
David Busby  ----->  Apparently he got a 96 too...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I kinda don't care that much.. Sam got me one and I dont even care about his IVs. He is going to 30
Keaton Rhea  ----->  With mewtwo, they all go to 30 for me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I just played 18 holes of golf... More like 12 and I gave up in most of those... First golf game since high school when my dad took me. I did BAD, but at least it was fun.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Lol. I've never played a game of golf in my life, so you probly did better than I would have
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was just happy to hit the ball...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I better stick to puttputt....lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I kinda wish we went putt putt haha @Daniel R 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What's going on in the all group. Are those real people or are they just adding fake accounts made this week?
Michelle U  ----->  Who added them to the Groupme? are we getting trolled cause if so, they're pretty bad at it 😆
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I just checked and I dont get it. They are not good at what they are trying to do....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looks like it getting ugly. Good thing I don't need the big group for anything
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well Cindy and I are out of the main group apparently 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Y’all kick them now
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Before everyone is out
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  If you don’t have the group muted, mute it now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its over. I think they kicked them all
Keaton Rhea  ----->  A bot came thru and kicked everyone I saw
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Wow. Honestly...probably for the best
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Did anyone see who added the first one of them?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I should of took a screen cap, but it was slew of kicks
Michelle U  ----->  How does a bot kick in a groupme? I got removed also
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Big group is prob dead. Well for now it is. Shep is prob only one left. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dont know what we can do about it now
Darren May  ----->  What about the link Ian posted in discord? Can anyone use that to get back in?
Michelle U  ----->  Did they use that bot to get rid of the trolls? That was flynnius maximus
Cindy R  ----->  Just tried. It said I couldn't join the group.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If you are kicked, I think you have to be added back by someone already in
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  We still have people in
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok good. At least there are some ppl still in
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its coming back online
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson don't forget kentoo lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I didn't know if it was already discussed after the chat violation but who are the admins and are there an agreed upon person to add new comers?
Amanda  ----->  Everyone can add only admins can kick. 3 from each team I think.
Darren May  ----->  In the main group. Should we gort mystic only group?
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don’t think the Mystic group will ever be to the point that it’s an issues. If Taylor wants to set it up though it won’t hurt anything. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Probably wouldn’t hurt to add him in. I can also appoint other admins since I’m not around anymore
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Caught one of these little guys at the museum today!
Michelle U  ----->  Looks like a wonder ! :o 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Top appraisal. Max HP.
Ian Fraser  ----->  But was it shiny tho? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope unfortunately. But the size.. Its just colossal!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sorry to report nothing in the swamp. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well maybe a little something 
Amanda  ----->  Lol🤷🏻‍♀️ Our swamp had stops and a gym, but no gator sightings
David Busby  ----->  Hey that’s a gen 4 or gen 5 release!
David Busby  ----->  If you need gold on a gym shouldn’t you be the one berrying it 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  That’s my line of thinking
David Busby  ----->  So am I wrong to be defending this Cody dude?
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't think so. I'm pretty sure the storm has other reasons for accusing him, but there is no reason to call him out on such a small thing as hatching a bunch of eggs (which he could have theoretically done in 30 km). If they want to accuse him, do it properly, but otherwise name bashing isn't cool.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes or no to add to big group? I think I met him, but I know the guy who is recommended him be added back.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only met him at raids but they are both low lvl. I help them with EZ raids on campus sometimes (assuming its the same guy). I can remember his trainer name at all tho
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think no. A hard level 30 requirement will help avoid favoritism.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just wanna make sure he is not a normal spoofer
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh. You mean big group. Oops
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No this is big group @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Do you have suspicion that he is a spoofer? I think in general, we should assume they're not.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not at all. Just wanted to to check name bc of ttown problems!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think he is a pleb but a good guy if its who I am thinking
David Busby  ----->  I’m all for adding that skinner dude into big group but not mystic group 
David Busby  ----->  I’ve seen the name around auburn enough
Amanda  ----->  Okay...Ken doesn’t listen, so...he’s uncoachable, therefore unmentorable...
Ian Fraser  ----->  Huh?
Amanda  ----->  Lol. 
Cindy R  ----->  Oh no, that's bad if even you can't help him @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson ..lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  What’d he do lol? 
Darren May  ----->  @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson may be experiencing the Kentoo Corollary to Darren’s Rule of Being Nice to Everyone. He is ok unless you are around him for any period of time.
Amanda  ----->  Myself along with a few others told him to pinap his shiny Lugia b/c of guaranteed catch. He looks at us like we’re all crazy...shows us that he first ball golden razzed it. Explained again it’s a guaranteed catch and he will want the candy. He then states that he only has 3 pinaps and 100 Golden razz 🤷🏻‍♀️
Darren May  ----->  Really burying the lede since he now has a shiny Lugia too
Amanda  ----->  Then continue to interrupt mine and Adriel’s convo with random crap that had absolutely no correlation to what we were discussing 🤦🏻‍♀️
David Busby  ----->  Kentoo is really good at doing that. Happened to me Zach and Keaton today at wilmore 
Darren May  ----->  As one of my casual friends sends me a photo of his shiny magby with the question have you seen this yet? 

What is this? Amateur hour?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I have a question of a somewhat philosophical nature. How do you think spoofing compares to having somebody else play on your account?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  They seem to be done for the same reasons and for the same results
Ian Fraser  ----->  The primary thing wrong with spoofing is solely related to gyms. Spoofing lets you to make no effort to take gyms, and makes it impossible to take gyms from you (with enough bots) 
Amanda  ----->  I agree with that.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I kinda don't really care either way if they do not harm/hinder/make my life harder in any way. That being said, sam doing my mewtwo was the only time anyone else has ever even logged into my account.
Ian Fraser  ----->  This is of course 100% imo.

But personally I don’t care if someone wants to go get a khangaskan. I care if I literally can’t take a gym from you with you putting in zero effort. 
Amanda  ----->  I’ve never let anyone besides Adam on my account, and it’s mostly for raiding purposes...I however, do a good bit on his account.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also will never make an alt bc of FOMO. Blake got a 100 lugia today on his alt. I would b just as sad as he was
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm with Ian. As long as they aren't affecting me, I don't mind how much they cheat. I think though, that multi-accounting can give you more of an edge because of the essentially infinite berries you can give to a gym. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  That all makes sense. I know a lot of people here (and in auburn too) are very anti-spoofer but don’t have any problem having someone else play for them to get xp or do a raid or anything else. I got bored a few weeks back and was spoofing on my Valor alt just to see what it was like in Tokyo and New York but only walked around and caught a few Pokémon and never did anything with gyms, even dropping in them. Seemed harmless enough. I don’t think I’ll ever do it on my main, even after 40, but might play on my alt just like it’s my Nintendo DS once I hit 40 and don’t need to grind anymore and trying to figure out how to not hurt the game for others if I do
Amanda  ----->  We are also spoiled in a community like Auburn. Everything is close and very easily accessible. I’m only against the gym aspect like Ian said. In larger cities though it’s almost impossible to get around. I do think it takes the fun and community out of the game sitting on your couch playing.
Amanda  ----->  But Adams brother does it and mixes spoofing and going out. He’s also part of a discord that has strict spoofing rules.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  But yes, everything anti-spoofing is generally related to gyms so that seems to be the common thread 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Until pvp inevitably comes out
Ian Fraser  ----->  I think the biggest reason we’re so anti spoofing (and why I’m really glad we are) is because it’s a very steep slope from being a little okay with spoofing to having spoofers run the town ala HSV. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson You’re right about auburn. It’s a perfect place to play with a great community and nothing restricting travel. Houston has a great community but you can’t move around and play much, although there are some awesome places to drive to and walk around for a while. 
Amanda  ----->  Travel time getting to those places is ridiculous sometimes...13 mile drive in Orlando took 45 minutes.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I also agree that spoofing is a slippery slope in that once it becomes ok the community dies because fewer and fewer people get out and play. That was the best part of the game for me in auburn, hanging out with everyone and running into people when I went out every night 
Amanda  ----->  Same sometimes in Atlanta.
Ian Fraser  ----->  It also forces people to be a part of the community, which is honestly the thing that actually makes this game fun. 

I also feel that people who put a LOT of time into this game would feel a little cheated if we okay-ed spoofing.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I’m just a little sad because the game changed for me once I got here. I can’t get out and play as easily and the city is too big to have a community like Auburn’s. Instead they have a lot of little communities that are all great, but getting to get out and raid is a full day’s commitment and there are most no stops/spawns I can get to easily from my place. I work during the day and all the places to play are parks that are closed at night and traffic is too bad to drive around and play. The game kind of lost its fun to me so I’m pretty much just grinding to 40 so all my work so far wasn’t for nothing then I’ll probably become a huge casual
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :( I am sorry to hear that taylor. I hope you find a small connected community in hou soon#
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Soon!
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  The Rice community is great and I’ve met some people there I really like! But there is literally zero parking on or around their campus unless you want to pay $12 to park and play for a bit plus I have to drive about ten minutes to campus so it’s not something I do often. especially once I start my new job next week I won’t be able to get there until about 7:00 at night. Just going to keep grinding and raiding on the weekends and getting my last 2 mil 😁
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  The drive really isn’t far but it’s not something I like to do for a random raid
Darren May  ----->  I agree with Ian and Sam. I think multi accounting is just as annoying to me at this point because of the added time to take valor gyms. It has always been weird to me how we are so much more lenient towards it compared to spoofing.  I think there are is a large grey area but I almost wish we were zero tolerance there too or a gentleman’s agreement to only put 1 account in a gym per person
Darren May  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt Just come back to AU man
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Darren May Been thinking that I need to play a trip back to auburn that lines up with when I hit 40. Only seems right to do it there
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  plan
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Also still a little salty that I was in the middle of moving and getting settled here during double xp or I’d already be 40 and this wouldn’t be such a drag 😛
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not gonna lie. I am pretty anti-social. I did kinda go out of my way to not have to interact with anyone way back in old gym system. But I regret that, should of just checked out mystic chat long ago. Great community here
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Yeah I remember jenny and I used to always see you over in Zion and Boykin and wonder who you were
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The amount of times I solo sam harris lvl 10 gyms vs instinct to send a msg is pretty high haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I went out early morning only. Hit first gym around 7 was ideal
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also worked with chase, so I got to see the aftermath in the chat of why you dont go to sam harris haha
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I haven't caught on the chat but what level is kento's instinct account?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  24ish? Dumpster fire regardless 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It does raids only. It is bad, but has some good legend back ups
David Busby  ----->  Late to the convo but for me multi accounting and dropping other people in gyms is one of the most, if not the most, annoying part of playing in auburn. Jin is the only one I’m ok with doing it because I’ve never seen him bully anyone with it. He takes his gyms in the morning for coins and then just leaves them. Doesn’t berry or anything. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Doubled like jin
David Busby  ----->  Oh and Jins other accounts are actually helpful in raids 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jin == helps the general good of auburn
Darren May  ----->  I agree although theoretically a benevolent spoofer could do the same thing. 🤷🏻‍♂️
David Busby  ----->  True and I while back I saw a post on tsr about a physically handicapped man that spoofed in his local community and I’d be ok with that
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea, there are people who could use spoofing in a positive way. On the other hand nothing illustrates the slippery slope better than muti accounting. When I started the game back up almost no one in the community had muti accounts and it certainly wasn't common. Now look where we are.
Darren May  ----->  Can we circle back to the earlier kentoo conversation? If @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson is out, who will be his mystic mentor when he hits 30?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  At this rate that's a next year conversation....lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  We don't necessarily need to give him a mystic mentor. Amanda has tried to reach him etiquette, and whether or not, he has learned any by 30, then we can give him some rules to follow and it'll be up to him whether he stays in the group.
Darren May  ----->  I try to be nice to kentoo but he crossed the line with mareep hate. He is dead to me
David Busby  ----->  And he threw shade at bulbasaur 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Also...there’s no way Ken has an ampharos right? Surely he should be the happiest one of all about this event 
Darren May  ----->  He has probably hatched 100% mareeps on all 4 accounts knowing his luck
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I hatched 2 yesterday that I had saved up in 10k eggs. That alone was near enough to evo one
David Busby  ----->  Am I the only one that kinda wants to mess with Leslie rn?
Darren May  ----->  Yes
Darren May  ----->  @Amanda Mesiarik Davidson Ooo. Good one
Amanda  ----->  I actually thought she already had it already. Makes a bit more sense about her posting them now.🤷🏻‍♀️ I just thought she liked Arons....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well maybe she can start evolving some and put them in gyms instead of owls.
David Busby  ----->  Or rats or pidgeys?
David Busby  ----->  Or she seems to like ariados too
Darren May  ----->  I can’t blame her for that. I’m throwing trash in my gold gyms all the time. And she apparently has gold almost everywhere in auburn
Michelle U  ----->  We definitely all associate her with ariados . That's all she would ever leave on campus for a while 😑
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ariados OP!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If it aint extra thicc and pink then I am prob not dropping it in a gym haha
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Come on people we all have. Better gym trash than that. There's no casuals in this group......right....lol.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Current gym trash
Darren May  ----->  I’m too much of a hoarder to have trash like that. Who knows when I might need all 20 of my level 20 ttars? 
Michelle U  ----->  Omg... your gym trash is better than what a lot of people leave on gyms to begin with 😂
Darren May  ----->  So I was going to look at some random pokes just to see how many I have but I stopped bc I have 8 nidokings, arcanines, poliwraths, slowbrows, and gengar each. I can’t remember if I intentionally cut them to 8 or if it’s a weird coincidence 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's meant to b darren. Cant transfer any of them now
Darren May  ----->  8 cloysters, rhydons and meganiums too. Weird
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You just need to ride to Montgomery with us and release that gym trash back to the system. Then you'll have room for all new gym trash. Lol.
Darren May  ----->  Idk, what if need those arcanines at some point?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby chase and I on way to goal post. At hatch?
David Busby  ----->  145 after we do Felton 
Amanda  ----->  Don’t you have a perfect Arcanine @Darren May ? 
Darren May  ----->  Nope just a 98.
Darren May  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt Has one I think
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just. 98 like it's nothing....lol
Darren May  ----->  Guess I should go ahead and max it out
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mine was low lvl so ive not powered him up yet
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pink and thicc defenders
Michelle U  ----->  Their names 😂😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah I guess some of them need real names haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Fixed! 
Michelle U  ----->  Too bad people can't see these 😂 I would have a hard time fighting Your Mom 😆
Keaton Rhea  ----->  David could see them when he had alpha. It is sad that nicknames do no show up
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Keaton Rhea You have two “Your Mom”
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Damn I guess I messed up. Oh well! I guess they can have two moms if they want if its 2018.
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser how do you change your nickname in iOS?
Amanda  ----->  You do it from the chat. Go to members and select your profile. @Sam Kawell 
Amanda  ----->  It will give you the option there.
GroupMe  ----->  Amanda Mesiarik Davidson changed name to Amanda
Ian Fraser  ----->  If you hadn’t figured it out @Sam Kawell the easiest way is: group settings > edit group

Sorry for the late response 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Thanks guys. I was asking for Caleb, but we figured it out.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  How do you add someone to the main group?
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Daniel R click on the group picture, then the members button, and then the plus button on the bottom of the screen. Then have them enter their email. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  If you have android.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Thanks.
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby do I hear you're fraternizing with the enemy?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What? That would never happen @Sam Kawell lol.
David Busby  ----->  Hey I gotta get my late night quests in somehow 
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I need my dps chart stat lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Already started lol. Looking like Mr ray ray by far best. Followed by dnite
David Busby  ----->  Really? BC holding ttar back? And no ice?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, all dragons are good with Gengar as a decent glass cannon
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No done ice but ttar is garbage :(
Sam Kawell  ----->  I've was good against Ray Ray because it was dragon and flying, so ice was double effective.
David Busby  ----->  Even going up against the dreaded db/dc
Sam Kawell  ----->  *ice
David Busby  ----->  Ok fair enough. I know all our ice attackers have garbage attack stats other than jynx 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well even jynx is worse than BC tyranitar
David Busby  ----->  Because no bulk I know 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes and cuno is BAD
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I mean from a DPS standpoint
David Busby  ----->  Well I’ll save my rares I guess 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ice just isn't the way to go against these two
David Busby  ----->  I’ve got a perfect level 35 pinsir I’m tempted to max but as I say that I think of all the times I gave Parker grief 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby @Sam Kawell did I forget anything?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Other than some poor croping.. I'll fix that
David Busby  ----->  I’m assuming 11 is level 40 ttar. You run numbers on stone edge?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  SE is about same. Slightly worse
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I see that error
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Salamence has slightly higher DPS than Ray Ray even though Draco meteor is a one bar move
David Busby  ----->  I’ve got the candy and dust to max or at least significantly power up a gengar. You think sucker punch or hex? Hex is objectively worse but is also getting STAB
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oo ok ill check him. Mence it is
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby I wouldnt bother with gengar unless you really want. Hex and SP are worse than SC and latios will eat thru him with psychic moves
David Busby  ----->  Didn’t even think about that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell @David Busby  look good enough to post in bigger mystic chat?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh rip I see another error
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I messed up my numbering
Darren May  ----->  Now have to fight the urge to use rare candies on my 96 bagon 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or rares on rayray!
David Busby  ----->  My question is are we thinking go ttar against double dragon latios? Or just suicide dragons
Sam Kawell  ----->   That depends on whether you like revives or damage balls.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm a damage balls man
David Busby  ----->  I’m also a damage balls man but you lose damage balls while rejoining 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Suicide dragons all the time.  Dont even bother with ttar on this one bx dmg balls > revives
David Busby  ----->  Crap not what I meant. Your losing dps while rejoining. Not still under impression rejoining resets damage balls 
Sam Kawell  ----->  That damage loss is difficult to calculate. I know that against Rayquaza, my dragons always survived sufficiently to get me max damage balls even against double dragon moves. Since latios and latias are less formidable attackers than Rayquaza was, I think dragons are the way to go
Sam Kawell  ----->  And their double dragon movesets does less damage than dragon tail outrage.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I agree with sam. The lati@s are both trio able I think too
Darren May  ----->  What about my shadow claw/dark pulse mew I’m going to get and power up any day now? 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dont have numbers on those movsets bc site has not updated mew's moves but pound bliz mew at lvl 40 is 11.6 DPS.
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May please don't. If anything it would be better with dragon tail blizzard
Ian Fraser  ----->  Soooo what you’re saying is using rare candies on Salamence is totally worth it? 
Darren May  ----->  But I’m going for that mew anyway to re-enact the movie fight with Mewtwo 
Sam Kawell  ----->  How many tms do you have...
Darren May  ----->  I’m feeling lucky
David Busby  ----->  Very lucky lol
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I feel like double dragon movesets will be avoided similarly to how blizzard kyogres were
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dragon breath is bad def move tho.
Sam Kawell  ----->  They shouldn't be. They'll be less bad than Rayquaza and people didn't avoid hat that much
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dragon claw will b kinda annoying, but very manageable
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  There were good alternates for ray though (ice) that don’t really work well here though right?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes bc ray is part flying. Ie 4x weak. Lati@s is part psychic
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ice types are super bad (or wet paper towels) in this game DPS wise. Most are tanks
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ice wont ve relevant atk until BW reisham
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think Taylor was saying that it will be harder to take down, because it doesn't have a double weakness. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  But because dragon moves are high in general dps, it'll be pretty easy to take down.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Is a Ray worth anything prior to 30? I have one at level 20..
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ray at lvl 20 is only doing 15.2 DPS
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So slightly worse than a lvl 40 BC ttar haha
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ha that’s great. What’s it do at 25?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  17.1
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lvl 29 is next break point and jumps to 18.7.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lvl 25 is first breakpoint
Darren May  ----->  Wait, so my boosted rays are already better than any of my ttars?
Sam Kawell  ----->  yup
Darren May  ----->  That’s dps only right? My level 30 Ray is behind several of my ttars depending on moveset
Darren May  ----->  In pokebattler 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  DPS only
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Does not factor survive
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell @Darren May let's give a trio a try for latios! It seems that a gaggle of dragons should do it. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yes please!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  How many total secs is a leg raid timer?
Sam Kawell  ----->  300
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok so it should b possible with just lvl 40 DT/O dragons
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dnites that is
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This is what I've got so far
Keaton Rhea  ----->  T2W is ~650 for lvl 30 ray and lvl 40 dnite. 
Darren May  ----->  Ok I’ll have to work on my team tonight. I’m not sure about spots 5&6 on my team
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think there will be enough interest that we can fail right as one hatches and still get a 4th, Darren. So do go crazy with power ups just for this!
Cindy R  ----->  We got pretty close with just huckleberry.  Your 3rd person may have a few better mons than him...so close..lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R it might be better not to use hera even with bug moves! I dont know if you have better counters and I realize this was the end, but in general hera does not like psychic moves
Cindy R  ----->  Yea, just rejoined during a 3rd round with him.  Totally wasn't a first or second round pick.  
Cindy R  ----->  I think we will try again when not solar beam. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok cool not trying to call you out! Just trying to help you get it next time! :)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah solar beam might b the hardest set if using ttars
Cindy R  ----->  Oh for sure! I love reading how you guys analyze and break all of it down!  I have 6 dragonites, 6 ttrs, a solomance, and ray that went through the rotations first.  It even mixed in aggrons at the end.  That heracross slipped in and I knew that second was gonna hurt..LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You might be able to beat it if you dont use any aggron! Aggron has great def, but his dmg output is really bad! He is potion efficient, but when trying to do a duo/trio, he can bring you down!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im not gonna lie, ive transfered a few so they will stop auto selection of aggron
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I bet you guys can do it trio with huckleberry. Just got to find huckle's best line up
Cindy R  ----->  I think you are right.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Your mains are prob overkill for trio. Pretty impressive to almost pull it off with a back up alt!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I have 2, 89 rays....15-15-10 or 14-14-13, which one to power up?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Break point is 35.5 for ray. Meaning you have to pwr up the 14/X/X to lvl 36
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So the 15 atk if you value candies/stadust. The 14 atk may live one quick hit longer, but will prob not haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is final by break pt. There ia another at 29 for 15atk that makes it equal to a lvl 40dnite dps wise
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda  watch chestb guy. @David Busby said he was a spoofer b4 he joined our group. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dont care that much, but david said his kid tattled on him about a shiny lugia in cali
Amanda  ----->  Got it. Thanks.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  David knows more. He added him! Im just letting you know
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Sorry what are the ray and dnite breakpoints again?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ray had one at 25, 29, and 36
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I do not remember the dnite ones off the top of my head tho but I can check those soon
Keaton Rhea  ----->  DtO dnite has 20.5, 24.5, 28.5, 36
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dragon breath has 24.5, 26.5.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  With dnite, you go from a T2W of 702s at lvl 28.5 down to 654s at lvl 36
Darren May  ----->  So I have 2 level 30 rays, 3 level 40 dnites and 1 level 29 dnite. Think that is good enough?
David Busby  ----->  The rays and dnites are at final breakpoints and I have enough ttars and mewtwos for a pretty solid team b
David Busby  ----->  I think one of our hardest problems will be finding right moveset to test trio out on with no scanners 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My B team is kinda bad. Might pwr up another ray to 30
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I say just dont worry about moveset. Just go for it right at hatch. If we fail, cry a little and call for help!
Darren May  ----->  I’m 14 candies from a level 35 96 salamence. 😬 I would also consider powering up 1 latios if I can get a goodish one. Is it comparable with the other dragons?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He is not bad and has a fun moveset for normal gyms. At lvl 32 he gets up yo 16.6 DPS
Amanda  ----->  I feel like I can help 3 man one...😁
Amanda  ----->  I can even be huckleberry’s stand in
Darren May  ----->  Wow how do you only have 600 pokes?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->   No sacrifice no victory....lol
Amanda  ----->  I did a major clean out, and I am also not keeping a live dex anymore🤷🏻‍♀️
Amanda  ----->  Didn’t wait on double candy either for legendary because Of the rare candy I get from raiding too much.
Cindy R  ----->  @Amanda We must try that 3 man out.  I definitely think we can do it.
Cindy R  ----->  You inspired me to start cleaning mine out...i made it to about 1000 mons....LOL. I have to get back to it. 
Michelle U  ----->  what does that mean, live dex?
Darren May  ----->  Takes his 1300 pokes into hiding
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Michelle U a living copy of every poke in their active inventory
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You can take it a step further and do what Chase is going for. A hundo living dex
Cindy R  ----->  She is not keeping the evolves for everything.  For example I had a male and female of every evolved Pokemon.  I started trashing the useless ones.  I didn't make it very far with it tho...LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like instead of just keeping a pidgeot, she had a pdigey, pidgeotto, and a pidgeot
Michelle U  ----->  ohhh. yeah that would probably save a lot of space if I stopped doing that also..
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nothing wrong with hoarding!
Amanda  ----->  I keep all my 100’s, so I guess my goal is the same as Chase’s. At least 1 of each.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Who is masquerading as Gort in the main group?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Matt D
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All caps GORT is the bot. Lower case Gort is matt
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah I picked up on the fact that there were two, but I didn't know who was doing it. I don't recognize the name, though...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dillon42 or something like that. He was 40 b4 jazzy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think he was second 40 in AU area behind Jay wilson
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh, I recognize that username
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes it was his son's but he stopped playing and then matt started playing a ton and took over the account. His whole family plays some
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Who is dis?
Sam Kawell  ----->  That's a slowbro. They evolve from slowpoke
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol yes. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Name change? Or out of town person?
Sam Kawell  ----->  jk, never heard of her
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Latios has been duo’d
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/89hmpj/latios_duo_with_13_seconds_left/?st=JFKEM5SN&sh=3e3abfd6
David Busby  ----->  Who the hell is John Peckham 
David Busby  ----->  Also that’s gotta be weather boosted right?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yep
Ian Fraser  ----->  Zen head hurt/HB
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  John is ComponentOwl. One of the OG mystics I told you about a few weeks back, he went awol for a while but messaged me earlier and asked if I still played cause he was getting back into it and trying to find people to raid with
David Busby  ----->  Oh ok cool 
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea We just 4 manned a boosted latios. Could be duoable under right conditions I think
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I just saw the video taylor posted where it was duo'd but ive not watched it yet to check moveset!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Solar beam would be best and it would only be doable with two full teams of dragons
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think our trio should work out well
Darren May  ----->  Yeah I can’t duo it but you guys or Amanda or Adam may be able to
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't think I could do it either, cause this is my second one team
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  It was duo’d in windy weather and I know the charge was solar. I think First guy had 3 maxed Rays, 3 Max’d dnite, and a second team of powered up dragons and maybe Mewtwo? Second guy had a first team of 3 max Ray/3 max Dnite and revived the rays and one dnite for second team and filled with two other max dnites. If I remember correctly
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Either way it was pretty much two teams maxed out 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Finished with 13 seconds left though 
David Busby  ----->  I made an executive decision and added questiony2k to the mystic group. That’s the taylor 29 dude 
Darren May  ----->  Less than a million to 40 and drunk with power 😂
David Busby  ----->  How close?
Darren May  ----->  Looks like a mass evolve with my 1 lucky egg is in my immediate future 
Darren May  ----->  Or I could buy more space...In other news, all the casuals getting mew is testing my resolve to wait for a good photo op 
David Busby  ----->  I’m waiting for the right time as well
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have been thinking about a good photo op for my mew as well. Pete kinda already took my first idea
Darren May  ----->  What was Pete’s?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  With his doggies on each side and mew on his shoulder haha
Michelle U  ----->  Dogs seem to be popular. I liked mavericks
Cindy R  ----->  Oh fun, we were lame and didn't do a pic.  Now I wish we had.  Lol
Michelle U  ----->  We did our at our school pokestop. I think a gym or pokestop would be cute ☺
Darren May  ----->  I’m trying to get into the samford bell tower
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Michelle U you used props too with the ultra ball!
David Busby  ----->  I can’t really think of a good idea for mine. @Darren May You need to get your costume back for it 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Darren, you should do your and snookems at same time in costume!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  AND at samford bell tower!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  anyone know off the top of head, how much dust from lvl 30 to 40?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Pretty sure it's 150k
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok cool. Not much then
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive spent over 500k dust today. This might be the coolest one so far! Gonna try him out in gyms for fun
David Busby  ----->  👀😱 jealous 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That one has 15 atk and I have another 13 or 14 atk SC that might get similar treatment
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The other is 14/13/10
Sam Kawell  ----->  Gilbert?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes... I usually just look at a pokemon and its named the first thing that comes to my head. It's usually about how fat they are, but he just felt like a Gilbert
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like to use the same first letter as offical name too. How gengar became Gilbert... I do not know haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But sometimes it's all wayy out in left field haha
David Busby  ----->  Metagross go
David Busby  ----->  Choose a nickname sorry that didn’t make much sense 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like a name for meta?
David Busby  ----->  Yes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Steven
David Busby  ----->  Ok I legit just had to stop attacking trinity cause I’m dying laughing rn
David Busby  ----->  Oh wait Nevermind I know why you did that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha yes. His signature poke
David Busby  ----->  I need names for two perfect machamps. Usually I just name after whatever books series I’m reading at the moment but no ones gonna get that when I take screenshots 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My first was named maverick I think. On GBA. After dallas mavs
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby Magellan, Malik, Marco, Markus. For meta?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just FYI, I am not allowed any say on naming our kids
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Lou
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She has seen the pokemon names...
Darren May  ----->  I can get into the bell tower but I’m not sure I can get in on such short notice. I don’t know where my costume is and my wife is not supporting my endeavor. No way I’m waiting on snookems. 😂 #pogoproblems
Darren May  ----->  I’m going to hunt for it tonight though. I won’t wait past Saturday, photo op or no
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Some of you have too much time on your hands lol.
David Busby  ----->  I can claim my mew now but I need the photo op and someone to take photos 
Darren May  ----->  Hey what if we did our photo together? @David Busby @Sam Kawell @Keaton Rhea @Sam Kawell mystic mew squad?
David Busby  ----->  I’d be down to wait for that
Darren May  ----->  🤦‍♂️only one of San though
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ooooo, i would love that. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im down. Im only at ghost quest sadly and leave town thurs night for a wedding. You guys don't have to wait on me tho
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You did say you had already  lost your dignity to this game so why not...lol.
Sam Kawell  ----->  It'll probably be Monday at the earliest, though, cause I'm in Huntsville and Birmingham for an interview and baby showers
Sam Kawell  ----->  So I'm basically in mantas position lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  And that's only one baby shower not multiple
Amanda  ----->  So 4 separate photos with each of you holding your Mew...sounds pretty awesome. As long as David is feeding his a cookie. Also, please take turns wearing Darren’s costume. Last thing...make David’s last and ya’ll take turns pouring salt on him...toomuch????🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Amanda  ----->  Possibly surround yourselves with Keaton’s plushies and Sam’s bike.
Amanda  ----->  And snookems photo bomb.
Amanda  ----->  I’m done.
Amanda  ----->  Actually Sam’s Mew should ride his bike
David Busby  ----->  I’m in with all of that ^^^^
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Here are the plushies I have. Let me know if anyone wants to use a specific one for photo op!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rowlet is kinda covered up and the espeon and umbreon are shiny
Darren May  ----->  I’m in. I can wait until next week.  Unless they release a new quest...
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm ready for midnight
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, you can now do split screen with Pogo. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was able to do that 2 updates ago! It's impossible to throw (well for me) so I never use it hahs
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Little jealous of the rowlet. Also digging the dragonball. Your a nerd after my own heart lol 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha yeah its getting so bad (well really good) that I have a goku mouse pad
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The collection not allowed in living room sadly, but I get to decorate the guest bedroom!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like to collect things
David Busby  ----->  I’ve got a friend that would be supremely jealous of those SI magazines 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So you're a tom Brady fan?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F#*% tom!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The football is an autographed super bowl 50 logo printed ball. The other thing is a wheaties box and a DVD. I also have his autobiography 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its the full SI magazine on all. Not  just the covers.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have a problem...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell I refuse to like your msg but I will dislike it all day...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Collector's don't have problems just good taste.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I intensely dislike him myself, and I have mixed feelings about Peyton, because he beat my bears in the super bowl. Other than that fault, I do like him.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Good to hear! Any brady hater is my best friend!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well here's you some non sports collectibles.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Those look awesome!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Hopefully you don't have the same addiction I do. It didn't stop with starwars.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Heres my main collectable: a Lego Saturn V
Sam Kawell  ----->  (old picture)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R sadly im just getting started....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That saturn V is good looking too. Loved my legos
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Legos maybe the only thing I don't have but that is cool.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Legos were more my childhood than Pokemon. I have far too many...
Cindy R  ----->  Please don't encourage daniel...I can't handle his level of "collections"  LOL
Amanda  ----->  I’m serious about duoing a Latios ya’ll. 👀dust...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell I knew someone like that. His parents were wealthy and he had around 6 or so tubs of nothing but legos. Like 4ft wide. 2ft deep.  2ft tall. He had spill over
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Amanda! Its very difficult to duo with ttar. Sadly ray and dnite are better bc of B/C moveset DPS
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, my 5 siblings and me would essentially ask for nothing but Legos every birthday and Christmas. So you can imagine what our basement looked like.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What I'm starting with
Amanda  ----->  They basically only went 4 deep into second team....I just need one more 15 attack ray to 30...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  With that u should be able to duo.. But I am pretty sure the vid had solarbeam as move for lati and windy weather
Amanda  ----->  Salamence is a 15/13/15 and needs 30 candy and 29,000 dust.
Amanda  ----->  It did
Amanda  ----->  So I just sit and wait. It will happen again.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  For second string would you do low cp rays or high cp gyrodos?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lvl 25 rays do very well! I don't remember exact dps for B/C gary but I bet ray can do better
Amanda  ----->  I have another Bagon that is 14-15-14 that is already a 30....and a Bagon 15-15-14 that is a 20...probably so that before my other Ray.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ill try to check and run numbers tomorrow, but I doubt gary is worth it for lati@s
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Daniel R level 20 Rayquaza is far better than level 40 Gyarados
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell thanky! :)
Sam Kawell  ----->  But level 20 Ray Ray will die quite quickly
Cindy R  ----->  Y'alls line ups are quite intimidating lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  Actually an air slash/outrage level 20 Ray will be better than a level 40 BC Gyarados
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I really think large groups of pure mystics will do well with ttar only. Not max but rock solid
Sam Kawell  ----->  Fun fact
Cindy R  ----->  But these don't last long with solar beam..lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I was gonna add solar...
Amanda  ----->  I want my rare candies back that I just have sitting on legendaries that I haven’t powered up....
David Busby  ----->  Y’all think that’s good for a trio 
David Busby  ----->  Of course I could always max revive team one if necessary
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think it's good enough for a shot
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell @Darren May trio at wilmore or davis?
Darren May  ----->  I could do wilmore 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I could do Wilmore, but I need the coins so if someone starts fighting it, let me go.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oops sorry sam. I berries everyone right when the egg popped up
Sam Kawell  ----->  It's all good.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If they fight for it, then ill let you drop off
Sam Kawell  ----->  Someone is fighting Wilmore @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I might not be able to keep it. Going to davis now
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't care about the gym balls anyway
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its anthony
Darren May  ----->  @ me for wilmore time. Working on my annual performance review 😬
Sam Kawell  ----->  May I request 10:45?
Sam Kawell  ----->  And @Darren May we just triod the one at davis with Zach, so it is totally possible.
David Busby  ----->  Lot of time left 
David Busby  ----->  ?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Not a ton, but I think my dragons are on the weaker side of most teams. I only have one maxed and most are around 33-34. I have a butt load, though
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, props to anyone who understands my Dragonite's name
David Busby  ----->  Tolkien?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Has someone read the silmarilian?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh wow not in years 
David Busby  ----->  Long time ago but that just has the Tolkien ring to it 
David Busby  ----->  Also cmon Sam your talking to a bunch of nerds lol 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May @Keaton Rhea @David Busby I'm ready
David Busby  ----->  @Daniel R Only 6 minutes left on raid 
David Busby  ----->  We’re starting 
Cindy R  ----->  Ok 😊
David Busby  ----->  So jmac really believes gort is a bot talking to him. He even dm’ed him 🤦‍♂️
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell @Keaton Rhea new addition. May be able to shave a few seconds of the trio time 
David Busby  ----->  Ok Leslie might have won me over tonight
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Why’s that?
David Busby  ----->  I’m a sucker for animal pictures 
Darren May  ----->  In case #mysticmewsquad falls through 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just think about huckleberry by level 40
David Busby  ----->  That little effer has better rays than I do 
Cindy R  ----->  I feel ya @David Busby ...I think we are gonna use his one name change and it be kallamazuu...lol
David Busby  ----->  Buckazu?
Cindy R  ----->  Good one!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And those bagons were hatch......which means I only have a 93...lol
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Kallamaroo?
David Busby  ----->  I might like Taylor’s better
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Who is this Taylor you speak of?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Don't be trying to change buckaroo's name....lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  So I just interviewed for a job in Huntsville and it seems like a really cool job with cool benefits. But it's on a military base. So there are literally zero Pokemon
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ayyy Redstone! I feel like the base I went to in NJ had a few gyms though...
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think they removed all pogo things from military bases.
Sam Kawell  ----->  At least I'd get work done, I guess
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Military bases are complete black holes in OSM/PoGo
Cindy R  ----->  That's so sad!
David Busby  ----->  Weren’t they not at first and people got in trouble pokehunting on the base?
Cindy R  ----->  Yeah. That's not somewhere you want to get in trouble...lol
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Probably works both ways. Many remote bases have to restrict any cellular usage so that they can’t be picked out on a map in the middle of nowhere (mostly relevant to foreign bases) but yeah it’s a mutual benefit to keep the areas clear 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think we have a strange pink rat problem
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, I don't know if it's been been discussed in the main group, but I really think they will release shiny gen 1 on Tuesday. All of the not already shiny Pokemon sprites look different for the Kanto region.
Ian Fraser  ----->  So apparently there are some gyms on base in Laughlin Air Force Base in TX according to Catie who just got back from there so idk 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I didn't see much of the arsenal, so I dunno. I just heard that there was nothing on military bases.  I hope to be able to see more though, if I get the job.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There is a gym on the arsenal near the NASA buildings that had spawns near it. @Sam Kawell a think a stop or two that I've seen. They nerfed the spawns big time compared to launch tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The gym was still there as of jan
Sam Kawell  ----->  I called it!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Shiny hype!
Cindy R  ----->  @Daniel R ....your favorite thing...LOL. Shinies!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Better odds overall now tho. More species have shiny chance. Its time for daniel to turn that bad luck into good luck and catch a few the first day they come out!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, now people can work on a somewhat unique collection of shinies. I'm excited.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  For some to have unique collection.... @Amanda will have them all I am sure
Cindy R  ----->  LOL, Amanda will have them for sure!
Darren May  ----->  Dat shiny nidoking doh
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Nidoking, seadra, umbreon, and ninetails are the ones I had my eyes on
Darren May  ----->  Ooo raikou looks good
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think they should give shinnies there own number.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Pokedex wise.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think they are following the main seires guide and global dex numbers. In main series, shiny is calcualted in a combo of your trainer ID, hidden cartridge ID, and a PRNG OR (only in new games) an TRNG roll. We dont know if niantec is using a TRNG
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Keaton Rhea would love to have more info on that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Niantec, I have no idea what they do... But its been a while since I was abusing RNG in main series haha.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There is a windows based app that I used for a while where u type in what you want stat wise (all IVs). Nature is not guaranteed. And you have a huge % chane of getting what you want if you can start game at right time
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But keep in mind, you can NOT do it on new systems. They have TRNG. You have to use a system that is 3DS (original) or older
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The DS lite is the best for it. It has an analog clock face app by defualt on home screen to time it!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The PC based app has a big spreadsheet that has a lookup table to find what you want. You set the date and time for what it says (almost anything is possible bc of this) and you search for nearest possible combos. Getting your hidden ID is a pain tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry for the spam :/
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt PRNG = psudo random number generator. TRNG = true random number generator
Keaton Rhea  ----->  A ton of my current research is in the RNG area
Ian Fraser  ----->  I assume it’s incredibly hard to tell the difference without a huge sample size? 
Cindy R  ----->  Ok I have to get a purple lapras!!!
David Busby  ----->  So when are we doing our mew photo shoot? I have to be at work at 5
Darren May  ----->  Well lunchtime is easiest for me but I forgot any potential props or costumes
David Busby  ----->  I’m also now thinking I save my mew for hitting 40...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You might have to do it without me. Ive got 2 raids left, then the 7/8 quests. But I can bring in any props if you want for tomorrow.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I should be free anytime today or tomorrow morning, but I'm leaving for north Carolina shortly after noon tomorrow.
Darren May  ----->  I’m fine with waiting. The rest of the tasks are pretty easy after 10 raids
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Keaton Rhea If you’re trying to get past the 50 berries one as efficiently as possible, I found that throwing a nanab and then throwing a straight, bad throw was a pretty good strategy. Poke breaks out, rinse, repeat. Each berry used counts even on the same encounter. I had to do it that way because I wasn’t moving around a lot and had to maximize my spawn contributions but if you’re easily running into 50 pokemom then you can just go for the catch
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks Taylor! Ill try that. Just find a 1kCP murkrow haha
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  That’ll do the trick 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Anyone know degocommando?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Why does It seem like the only people in the main auburn group are all new or casual?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Because they are...lol
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Changing of the guard @Daniel R . We must let the students (try to) become the masters
Ian Fraser  ----->  Because all the hardcore people either only really talk in Mystic or Storm or are burned out 
Ian Fraser  ----->  It’s hard to see from the inside looking out but it seems like a lot of people started playing again when quests came out 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Yeah T4 and T5 are really the only things the big group is needed for, and since most people who are active can do it with 3 or 4 people now there isn’t a lot of coordination needed. Once people get the minimum they stop asking 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I guess I better start 2 other accounts because we can't hardly put together an afternoon raid. I guess all the veterans do provide chats only.
David Busby  ----->  Only time I really usually find mystic only raids is when I come on campus during the day
Darren May  ----->  Also more people have hit 40 and the current legendary isn’t that great so there aren’t people doing crazy amounts of raids anymore 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We only have a each so we may have to start hitting Montgomery raids 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hey @Darren May dont b hating on latios! He is cool
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im not saying he is the best, but im definitely taking one to 30
Darren May  ----->  I think he is cool but not at the raiding level of rayquaza (especially during double xp) and Lugia with shiny chance
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I agree for battles he is worse than ray and dnite; however, I never got a DB/DC dnite. So im gonna use the best I get for gyms
David Busby  ----->  If I get a 96+ I might take it to the top and use up there with my machamps
David Busby  ----->  Until I get a shiny machamp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He is green! Hulk like
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok, I finally got my stuff done
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby @Sam Kawell @Darren May time, place, and which props do we need for tomorrow?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Most of you have busy schedules compared to me so ill for what you guys have to do
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry Darren, but I dont have a nidoking plushie... Yet
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'll be open until 11:30, and I'm only planning on using my bike
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess david just needs a 5lb bag of salt
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im going to use my ttar and shiny umbreon plushie. The rest are up for grabs for props
Michelle U  ----->  I'm so excited to see your guys pictures!! � if anyone wants to borrow my ultra ball they can, emily also has a mystic baseball hat
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We might need a photographer too!
Cindy R  ----->  @Amanda ...Matt got here early to take the gym..we are around the corner berrying..LOL. We'll see how long it takes for him to come looking for whose doing it.  🤣🤣🤣
Amanda  ----->  Awesome. On our way now.
Cindy R  ----->  Dang...jazz just got here...about to be made. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R you guys are stronger than jas!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby @Sam Kawell @Darren May pics location? Im guessing sam and darren have to work, so can you swing by davis/samford area for pic? Or we can get uber to take us to somewhere near by?
Sam Kawell  ----->  I was just assuming Samford park
Darren May  ----->  Ugh casual luck
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What?! Shiny absol? That is Amanda skillz (not luck)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And cant even spell mewtwo? Like makes me super jelly
Darren May  ----->  Same guy who hatched the shiny magby. Also has shiny altaria 
Cindy R  ----->  I had Amanda's luck this afternoon and got a shiny absol 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  When is Matt selling his account? I guess its time for me to finally have an alt........
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wooooo! Glad for you @Cindy R ! :)
Darren May  ----->  I’m on standby for tomorrow morning. The 2 yr old had a trampoline incident tonight so I may have to take him to the orthopedic clinic tomorrow 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh no! I hope he will b ok! Sorry tk hear that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  To hear
Cindy R  ----->  And fyi...they will come out and run you off after dark at keisel park..lol. 
Cindy R  ----->  Oh no Darren!!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can wait no worries from me. kids health comes first
Darren May  ----->  Well we made it a year with no injuries after 3 broken bones in 6 months
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It all averages out!
Michelle U  ----->  Poor thing ! Hope everything turn out ok !
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea If your talking about traitor Matt you don’t want his account. It’s straight garbage 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea will there be a new type added in the next few generations?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dark was added gen 2. Fairy gen 6. We have both already. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There have been rumors of sound/sonic based type or sun light, but they have never added them. SuMo kept the chart the same
Sam Kawell  ----->  Cool. I'm almost done with my steel badge and I would hate for them to add a new one soon after I finish all the old ones.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I really cant see them adding another type. Most of the type advantage triangles are pretty balanced
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You do kinda have all the original ones haha I forgot they added steel gen 2 as well
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well 30 more until all gold
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wow, @Keaton Rhea its not every day that Davis is graced with a 3200+ Blissey
David Busby  ----->  I love berrying that thing
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha thicc girl has not been out in a while. She needs some action!
David Busby  ----->  @Darren May Blissey too
Darren May  ----->  Photo time at the davis latios? I should be able to make it barring something unexpected 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Do we want to say after the Davis raid, 10:15?
David Busby  ----->  I’m assuming @Keaton Rhea will be able to make it 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can do either!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh mis read that. Yes after is good
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @David Busby the force has noticed a flux in lucky eggs. How's the exp coming?
David Busby  ----->  Less than 100k
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Aww man I was not paying attention at lunch and thic girl got shaved out of davis
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Does anyone recognize the names in after?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think it was bunnypaws 13 but they took about 5mins b4 they placed. I might of been shaved off just bc of my name haha
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Now all you have to do is start grinding star.dust. After all can't have a level 40 mystic with empty exp....lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Come join us @David Busby 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We still do mass eveolve. 30 million exp will not get you into the top 20 on this list.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Are you over the 30 mil mark, Daniel?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Nope about to be 28 million and that outs me at about 30th in the list
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh wow still impressive! Im only at 25.6M but I have not done a mass evo since I hit 40
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Keaton Rhea i think we would be over 30 million if we hadn't been so gold gym focused these last 2 months.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im pretty gym casual. If its gold then its gold. Unless its sam harris... It is my goal to make everyone but the mystics work for that one haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think I have around 900k exp in pidgey candies alone right now. No clue about other trash fodder
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Are Cindy and I the only 2 left working in parker for gold? Do 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I finished Parker on Sunday
David Busby  ----->  I need in on Parker. There spots? It’s just been blue full up everytime I go by 
Cindy R  ----->  It's been a bunch of low level and us.  We are the first things in there so been trying to kept ourselves fed. Lol
Darren May  ----->  I’m still working on it too but I haven’t been battling gyms much the past couple of weeks 
Darren May  ----->  And it’s always full
Cindy R  ----->  Yes, we have had a hard time getting in!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I am very glad to be rid of that gym. It fills up far too quickly
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'll keep everyone in mind for parker and not berry the trash that's in it now.
Amanda  ----->  So this is how close Adam and I got in the windy weather duo against Solar beam. He has powered up his Salamence to 40 and his 2 rays weren’t all the way to to the 36.5 breakpoint. I think we’ll be able to do it next time, but in the meanwhile which one of these Bagons should I go after??
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Do both. I'm sure you got a million stardust....lol
Amanda  ----->  There is a candy and dust issue with this one...I only have 40 rare...so I can only focus on 1😔
Darren May  ----->  I’ll let @Keaton Rhea answer on the bagon since he has all the breakpoint knowledge but it looks like y’all are close enough within the margin of error where some luck or changes of timing of charged moves would get you over the top. So definitely doable or duoable if you will
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes Amanda. The mence will help and so will an extra ray at 36.5.  Based on what I've seen, you just need 3 rays/mence at lvl 40 each and back up with lvl 40 dragons
David Busby  ----->  Shit did I miss windy weather 
David Busby  ----->  Salamence breakpoints in windy weather 
Amanda  ----->  It was in Florida David.
Amanda  ----->  So Adam’s power ups since should make us good to go.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Amanda You may have already done it but I’d go with the level 30 one. That 1 IV difference in attack is not going to keep you from hitting a breakpoint and it’ll be a lot less dust and candy to get it there
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Amanda 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Oooh unless that last breakpoint actually is unreachable with 14 atk? Looks like you can hit it but it’ll have to be maxed. Still much less candy and dust than taking it from 20
David Busby  ----->  That’s also a windy weather breakpoint sheet
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  It looks like that 39.5 is also a bulk point not a breakpoint right? 39 is the break?
David Busby  ----->  Charge move goes from 181 to 182 lolol
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Oh I wasn’t getting what the icons were I guess, not used to looking at that breakpoint sheet
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What's the difference with the next legendary? Will it require a different line up?
David Busby  ----->  No just higher defense
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope pretty much the exact same thing
David Busby  ----->  Also knows outrage instead of dragon claw 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Idk if that is worse or better haha
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Good news since I've been looking everything into all dragon types
David Busby  ----->  Well it’s gonna hit harder but not spam. At the same time it’s attack is lower. I know it’s hard to trip
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Pouring not looking....stupid auto correct
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm sure huckleberry will hatch a few more 98 baggons by Then 
Amanda  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Your Beldum gave me candy instead of my Bagon...I appreciate it, but...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was remote feeding them when I got this tag haha
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Did everyone already notice your buddy walking distance is down by half?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not until you mentioned it
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  No wonder huckleberry knocked out 300 carp candy so fast...lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  So I really want the legendary tomorrow to be a surprise and I'm not looking at the other two GroupMes in case someone is indiscreet. Might I ask you all to not post anything here even if you find out early?
Darren May  ----->  Already posted on silph road bro 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So don't read that either haha
Darren May  ----->  It has a spoiler tag at least
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I've been staying away from there too.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I know people have ways of finding out early
David Busby  ----->  Crap glad I haven’t posted lol 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  After the very mediocre pokes we've been getting I won't get my hopes up 
Darren May  ----->  At least you get double candy for this one
Amanda  ----->  🙄 Ken’s Mewtwo...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Who is technical victor?
Darren May  ----->  The guy who went from 25-39 during the last double xp event. May or may not be a spoofer or reformed spoofer
David Busby  ----->  He’s gotta be a spoofer. Got a hundo blissey and dragonite
David Busby  ----->  He was using an alt to farm gym points at Felton by dropping trash and using an alt to take out the trash then taking out the alt
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  He was in both keisles yesterday.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He and anthony have also been in sam harris lately
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm thinking full on spoofer
David Busby  ----->  He’ll show up in person but he’s also done 435 legendary raids yet doesn’t know where auburn gyms are
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We got huckleberry pretty hard through event, went from 28 to 33. That was endless lucky eggs and tons of raids including 12 on the last day.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Keilsle was also filled with name  I had never seen but his.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I will say with 100% certainty he’s a spoofer. Full on pitchforks. I’ve done the math and the only way he got that much xp was to do hundreds of raids during that time, and I know people at almost every legendary raid during that span that didn’t see him there. He only has like 7000 Pokémon caught as a level 40 so all his xp comes from raids.
David Busby  ----->  Well he can’t go through my barely 3000 blissey in thirty minutes 
David Busby  ----->  If I hadn’t done the initial berry up to full out of habit it wouldn’t be close 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And I bet that's who just knocked me out of a keilsle gym. I look later. Wasn't he just at felton?
David Busby  ----->  He’s still at Felton. My berry limit just reset 
David Busby  ----->  Freaking level 40 and can’t take out a single blissey
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  He can be a good example of empty exp....lol
David Busby  ----->  He’s not a good example. He is THE example 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I know the storm says they have proof that he is a spoofer, but there is no reason to bash him if we're going to do nothing about it. Why not bring this evidence to the main group and have him kicked?
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm sure the storm will back you up.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  When did he join?
Darren May  ----->  Yeah, why hasn’t he been kicked from the main group yet?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  People on get kicked if storm has the issue.
David Busby  ----->  We don’t have full on proof just truckloads of circumstantial evidence 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think the storm does. I was talking to Zach and Emily and they saw him taking out gyms at the museum when he definitely wasn't there (according to them).
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Also who is hamihammock?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Chase. He ran hambot
Keaton Rhea  ----->  When the scanners were working
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ok I don't think we've actually met just seen the name.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Sam Kawell I think he fessed up to that instance in the past but claims now that he doesn’t do it anymore. What that really means is that he doesn’t do it in auburn anymore - he plays legit here and there in auburn and spoofs to other places for raids when he’s at home
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  That’s why he hasn’t been kicked - because he doesn’t use spoofing like Omega or packman did to take gyms, most of us just have issue with him personally because he used spoofing tactics to go from 25 to 40 in a month and people (myself included) are salty about that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just think about how much money he had to spend...
Darren May  ----->  What kind of car does technical victor drive? @David Busby 
David Busby  ----->  Either red truck or silver/grey car
Darren May  ----->  Oh ok. Someone in a red car helped me briefly at camo. Thought he was knocking himself out
David Busby  ----->  Me jazzy and brad are taking down bridge 
Darren May  ----->  Cool. I wasn’t going to take any tonight but I had a few gym research tasks. He replaced the people I knocked out so I knew I had to take the whole thing down before I left
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Who replaced whom?
Darren May  ----->  I knocked out lee and amber and kept walking. TV and his girlfriend dropped in by the time I made a lap around the museum 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  In gonna,let parker go since Cindy was already out but if anyone can see just wondering who takes it
Sam Kawell  ----->  It was some random Valor
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just 1 person?
Sam Kawell  ----->  yup. Now it's two. A level 25 and a level 28
Sam Kawell  ----->  Bustinbaump and vincebeckpowell
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That was a good trick Cindy's blisse was a 3160 plus
Sam Kawell  ----->  What trick?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I thought it took 3 ppl to use that exploit to take down a full motivation mon?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Not often level 25 can take out one that size that fast
Darren May  ----->  The waiting is the hardest part
David Busby  ----->  I got a little tipsy and bought four boxes...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Four?!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You must of had a strong buzz haha
Darren May  ----->  Dude
David Busby  ----->  I may or may not have had to max my items 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Is zoran another was 29 2 weeks ago or just New? Just wondering as I've seen the name.
David Busby  ----->  He’s new
Sam Kawell  ----->  Is he here to stay? I know he's from australia
David Busby  ----->  Still never met him or seen him in a gym
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Do y'all ever hit Opelika gyms? Seems to be some shady, spoofy mystic over there
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He is not. This is zoran's vacation. His daughter plays on the AU tennis team
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Here for like 2 weeks I think. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He is a nice dude. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  well i guess he'll get 40 in auburn.
Sam Kawell  ----->  that's pretty weird
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sorry, you guys and gals live with kento i just have to read and sometimes his actions make me frustrated...lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R @Cindy R in case you missed from big group.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is the stop at sky bar and moes southwest
Cindy R  ----->  Thanks!!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :)
Amanda  ----->  @David Busby Where are you??
Cindy R  ----->  That's a funny name to see in Tallassee...Really close to Daniel's old game name.  And our old instinct pal Jazz was just talking about it.  Wonder if he's branching out..lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  I know I should be happy for them, but it makes me irrationality angry to see casuals catching shiny Magikarp, because they don't appreciate it half as much as I would given the chance.
Cindy R  ----->  I caught a little ole 61 cp shiny the other day and @Daniel R was ready to push me out of the car..LOL
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell Same
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I (mostly) don't begrudge you and Amanda for your luck because how often you play. It's just the infuriating casuals.
Cindy R  ----->  Amanda has way more shiny mons ....I'm jelly of her too...LOL
Michelle U  ----->  One of our classmates transferred 3 shiny m agikarps because he didn't know what they were. Made me so sad 😣
David Busby  ----->  Y’all have your own pharmacy groupme for Pokémon right? Boot him @Michelle U lol
Michelle U  ----->  Haha ! We've thought about it multiple times. He kicked us off gyms a lot 😑
Michelle U  ----->  But We return the favor 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Storm shows the door to any one that gets a hundo or shiny now. Only for 24 hrs tho haha
Michelle U  ----->  What?? That so harsh! Would make me not want to post anything
Michelle U  ----->  We joke in our groupme but we never actually do it. Just tell they are #banished 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah chase couldn't even organize goal post the other day bc of it. He had to go in with me. I think it's pretty stupid.
Cindy R  ----->  So what happened this time? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea that’s absolutely absurd. Barriers to the community is a big no IMHO
Ian Fraser  ----->  ...can’t Blake just demod the Storm if they do that? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Chase caught a 100% latios. In storm, than means a 24hr ban from their chat haha. So he had to do goal post raid with me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No its storm chat only ian. Jazzy runs that
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ohhh Storm chat. lol that’s so stupid 
Cindy R  ----->  Storm sucks... I am so thankful we didn't pick that team in the beginning.  What a nightmare it would be.  Lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  So what happened with the Valor chat, did the storm delete it? I tried following the GroupMe but I got confused 
Cindy R  ----->  Same here..lol. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Pretty much. A few valors started adding people to the group just for fun , we were all messing around and jazzy started kicking people left and right and added a couple storm in. Think valor ended up creating a new group 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Not sure I approve...Not a Valor fan but isn’t that literally what the Ttown people did to us and we were pretty peeved. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Yeah I would’ve been annoyed too. They were being cool and letting us in their group for a bit to hang out and ended up getting screwed for it. I’d be pissed because the groups have a ton of archived pictures and stuff that could be useful/fun to go back and look at
Darren May  ----->  So pseudo was right all along...jazzy is terrible but charismatic? 😂😂😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, it kind of makes him no better than those Tuscaloosa jerks. I don't think it's cool at all.
David Busby  ----->  Chase is in supreme counsel tho...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Everyone needs to really think about what's being said in private chats to each other. I keep my distance from most of this but all this comes from just a few players that think it's funny and get entertained by it.
Ian Fraser  ----->  If the idea was to make Pseduo apologize to the group for the issues he caused I feel like Jazzy should as well. At least to Valor. Different issues but making the game un-fun for people was the end point.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Not gonna lie, that worked better than I thought it would 
GroupMe  ----->  Keaton Rhea added Phil Pearson to the group.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Welcome Phil! Your too active to not be here.
Phil Pearson  ----->  Woo thanks!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ah man how am I gonna talk trash about Phil now.....lol
Phil Pearson  ----->  I’m still the only one in Felton..
Cindy R  ----->  Sorry @Phil Pearson ..we will be a few hours.  I have dr appt with my dad today. 
Phil Pearson  ----->  No worries! Just pointing it out
Amanda  ----->  Just dropped @Phil Pearson 
Keaton Rhea  ----->   @Sam Kawell  So apparently, you can just click on the side of the screen on the pre-made party list to cycle between parties. Thanks to @Michelle U  for the tip! I feel really dumb. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wow. I can't believe I didn't try that.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah it works so much better
Darren May  ----->  They fixed the 10 raids trick so Snookems is going to have to do it the hard way
Ian Fraser  ----->  They did? Nooooooooooooooooooo
Darren May  ----->  I read contradicting reports the past couple of days but it gave him credit and the beginning of the raid instead of after he failed 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  So now what they really mean is “use 10 raid passes”
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I didnt get a EX raid pass tor today.... But I've got french fries!
Amanda  ----->  😋 
Cindy R  ----->  Hmmm...that's the best way to make fries!
Michelle U  ----->  @Ian Fraser didn't you pass that stage? Or are you thinking for catie
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R the double fry is where its at
Darren May  ----->  I’m ready for Mewtwo. Just need a pass
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sticking with dark pulse?
Darren May  ----->  Probably for now. The mew gamepress article suggested going for a range of charge moves and being satisfied with what you got. I was able to get it with 3 tms so I can live with that.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ah nice only 3. I want dragon claw. But I've stuck with my dazzling gleam
Darren May  ----->  It took 13 fast tms to get shadow claw though. I got steel wing 3 times which seems crazy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Chase went thru 20+ fast tms for shadow claw. He got steel wing at least  times haha. I got shadow claw in 3 tries and just stoped.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was going to dragon claw earlier... The. Sam told me that even with 30 TMs I still only had a 73% chance of getting it...
Phil Pearson  ----->  Luckily mine came with dragon claw and I only used like 5 fast tms 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Michelle U I’m actually still on that stage because I started with 100 Karp candy and didn’t have time to get enough until the event! Was putting off sitting at a raid, but not I guess I have to wait a few more days. (Catie is also just now on that step too) 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So what do y'all think about frost breath/blizzard on mew? As that's what I have now.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Daniel R Seems better than what I’m working with
Michelle U  ----->  Aw.. well at least you guys can do it together! My plan was to do every single tier 1-2 raid I saw (before I knew about the trick)
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Surf......lol....damn
Ian Fraser  ----->  Maybe we can take one engagement photo with our Mews...I just have to convince Catie that it’s a good plan. 
Michelle U  ----->  That would be so cute!!!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Would anyone leave it on focas blast or keep going?
Darren May  ----->  Mew's Best Movesets "Mewvsets" [GamePress] - https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/8c0y0s/mews_best_movesets_mewvsets_gamepress/?st=JG03VADS&sh=91c5be46
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ok done
Darren May  ----->  Wow that didn’t take long
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  2 hits to get claw 5 to get ice beem.....statictics.....i laugh at the.....lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Words only spoken by Cindy and Amanda.... 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Now if we're talking me getting a shinny carp......ya........10000 to 1....lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  I swear she better have caught that Machop in Opelika @David Busby 
Darren May  ----->  I’m thinking maybe she doesn’t appraise things until at night. I can’t fault her for that but I have been appraising all my chops after catch for the good of the group. Not that I’ve caught a good one though
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Well she waited almost an hour to share it after she screenshot it...lol
Darren May  ----->  🤔
Darren May  ----->  I take it all back
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Someone come IV all these pokemon...5 hours of constant catch
GroupMe  ----->  David Busby added Jasvir Grewal to the group.
GroupMe  ----->  David Busby removed Jasvir Grewal from the group.
Amanda  ----->  👀
Phil Pearson  ----->  No
David Busby  ----->  I repeat; cold, dead body
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  All in favor of raising level requirement to 31 say nothing in the next 10 seconds
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Alright it’s unanimous, 31 it is
Ian Fraser  ----->  At some point we’re gonna have to let him or we’re gonna be the ones causing drama in the big group. Believe me I hate it as much of the next person. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Someday he’ll be 40 with all that empty xp then what we gonna do 
David Busby  ----->  Storm doesn’t let everyone 🤷‍♂️
Darren May  ----->  I mean if we add him and then boot him after he breaks the “rules” 3 times wouldn’t it be better?
Darren May  ----->  Or shadow mystic group?
David Busby  ----->  Keeping him out of big group causes trouble. Me being a dick just makes me a dick 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Darren has the right idea imo. 
Darren May  ----->  Seems like it should go without saying that we aren’t the storm
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If we add him, the only group we will use is this one. But I like the rules
Ian Fraser  ----->  I though we WERE the shadow mystic group. 
David Busby  ----->  Don’t make this like valor chat please
David Busby  ----->  Amanda knows what I’m talking about
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wait, we’re the Illuminati aren’t we? 
Darren May  ----->  Maybe fake mystic group is a better name
David Busby  ----->  Pete lee and Adam almost have completely stopped using valor chat
Darren May  ----->  Make a group with kentoo and all the people we purged
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Mystic JV
David Busby  ----->  Are we about to have a new NC17
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  AAA squad
David Busby  ----->  I can’t be in 6 auburn groupmes guys
Phil Pearson  ----->  ^*^
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Honestly guys I’m in way too many GroupMes for auburn PoGo already so whatever we decide to do with kentoo count me out
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Exactly 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Hey @David Busby at least you still live there
Ian Fraser  ----->  Alright I mean I’m totally cool with raising the bar to 31 but we’re gonna end up with less and less excuses as he gets all that raid xp. Just pointing that out. And we’ve definitely tried to not be Storm in general as Darren says. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I was being sarcastic about 31. It’s not a good solution
David Busby  ----->  I mean there’s also the chance he just never brings it up
Ian Fraser  ----->  🤞🏻
David Busby  ----->  That Daniel b dude just hit 30 and no ones felt the need to add him 
Amanda  ----->  We just use the reasoning that Taylor so eloquently expresses about the big group is where you need to be if you’re raiding...
Amanda  ----->  *being
Amanda  ----->  If he insists we allow, but no matter what his level...not in here.
Amanda  ----->  I just like trolling David with how close he is to 30😁
David Busby  ----->  Haven’t you guilted me enough
David Busby  ----->  Darren and Keaton didn’t go with you either 
Amanda  ----->  I know. I wasn’t for real mad... I yell when I’m for real mad.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well what if we just come up with some rules that will ensure that Kentoo minimizes his annoyingness (like prohibiting the spamming of raid alerts for non-useful raids or making sure he is courteous when filling gyms with his three accounts or anything else that is found annoying). If he chooses not to follow these rules then one of us can DM him to let him know he is crossing boundaries, and if he chooses to follow them then he's not annoying and no one can get mad. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  And if he gets DMed too many times he gets kicked, we're not being impartial and everyone wins
Ian Fraser  ----->  And maybe triple verification about where a raid actually is? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Anything you can think of. Those are the two things that annoy me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I vote avoid the question with him like the plague. If he insists, then we can add with the rules. Each time someone has to DM him, we report back here for total count but I doubt that is really needed.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I wholeheartededly agree about avoiding the question like the plague, btw
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I hate the off topic posts, calling out bad raids, blue raids we are trying to hold. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Adding him only fixes the later... Maybe
Darren May  ----->  Is it wrong that I’m highly amused at how some of the nicest people I know are all like “no thanks with this guy”?
Ian Fraser  ----->  I was on board with adding him until the 100% insisting that there was a raid at Davis when it was at first pres...


Oh and him asking about ghost spawns when I tagged him for some literally 20 minutes prior. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Alright so gameplan: don’t bring it up to him and see how long we can avoid him being added. If he corners someone and gets added, then we can make sure he 1) Doesn’t post any raids below T3 in here  2) doesn’t post any raids were trying to hold control of on big group 3) Chooses one account per gym to drop unless it’s been blue for more than two hours 4) doesn’t post about non-game related things
David Busby  ----->  5) learns to use spellcheck
David Busby  ----->  6) isn’t obnoxious af in person 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  That’s not spellcheck he’s just trying to be “hip” and use text speak
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Or hexadecimal
Sam Kawell  ----->  Honestly I would say don't post any tier 3 or 4 unless they are Machamp or Tyranitar or someone especially requested something.
Sam Kawell  ----->  *specifically
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. Champ and ttar are all anyone cares about. Or like when that guy asked for help for absol
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I typically think of it as don’t post anything you should be able to do alone. If he wants to try a T3 but can’t do it alone, I’d be okay with him asking for help
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Many good points. On thing we've been having an issue with in the main grpup5 is not knowing who all is mystic. We would like to be able to do mystic group raids it just rarely happens using just mystic group. Also not says any names but some with raid with any even when there's enough to do a mystic group.... 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Same goes for anyone else in mystic chat
David Busby  ----->  I’m ok with people asking for help with 4s for dex stuff
Sam Kawell  ----->  That's fair. Asking for help and if someone asked to be tagged for a specific raid is fine. But he calls out low tier raids even when he isn't doing them.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'd also like a way to know who's mystic and who's alt mystic
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I don't think anyone is in mystic if they only have an alt mystic
Sam Kawell  ----->  right?
David Busby  ----->  Only mystic alts are jin(slim Jin), brad(cs4alabama), pete(daysky), and jimmi
David Busby  ----->  No alt mystics are in mystic 
Ian Fraser  ----->  CivilDolphin too 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Don’t forget civil and moonpanda
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ex. If I ask in mystic chat by gamer name who's who someone should be able to say I.
David Busby  ----->  Civil had a perfect boosted with only 6 balls. That’s the 3rd perfect latios Zach has had on his screen in what 5 days
Keaton Rhea  ----->  1 for 3 catching tho...
Amanda  ----->  @David Busby I’m telling them you forgot them.
David Busby  ----->  I’ll give him 1/2.5
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Daniel R so you would like people to add their trainer name and level in the mystic group?
David Busby  ----->  @Amanda At least I hung out with them last night 🤷‍♂️
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  But do you actually remember it?
David Busby  ----->  Yes
Amanda  ----->  I told you...I like you guys, but I ❤️my babies🤷🏻‍♀️
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Maybe, would that help or hurt. It might hurt in the main chat. It might make low level targets in main but would be nice to know who is up any coming.
Amanda  ----->  M30
I30
V30
Big group????
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I do like getting notified when someone levels up by seeing them change their name instead of posting a screenshot
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don’t think we’d be able to get it to take hold in Mystic main honestly. Main reason we got it in big group was because we all started brand new and Sam took up the cause early on. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm confused. Are we talking about the raid group or the mystic group?
Amanda  ----->  I always hit the heart for them too. Even if they are 23 to 24🤷🏻‍♀️
David Busby  ----->  You gotta like it so they wanna do it more
David Busby  ----->  I do it for the likes half the time 
Amanda  ----->  Encourage good behaviors.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Maybe both. If someone wants in the mystics chat start by listing who you are early on.
Ian Fraser  ----->  The rush of liking a dozen posts cannot be described it must be experienced. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  It might be a little easier in the mystic chat cause there are only 60 people
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Btw kind of off topic but if anyone is looking for a new naming convention I’ve been using the last digit of each stat and I like it. If anything is 5 or below I usually won’t keep the mom anyway but in the rare situations I just put X so I know it’s too low to be significant. Got tired of not knowing if my 93 IV pokemon had 13 or 14 attack for breakpoint purposes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I usually just use IVs only. I dont care moveset or anything else until I power them up. Flip the moves to what I want. Then they get a real name haha
Amanda  ----->  Kinda do same thing, and like Keaton says only include move set after fully evolved/tm’d 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt The app I use for iOS lets you install a keyboard that makes it pretty easy. Little number is %IV followed by just ATK since that matters the most. 
Amanda  ----->  •💯•
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda oh I leave moveset off completely. No %. Just a name
Ian Fraser  ----->  The app is PokeRater, just realized I didn’t say 
Amanda  ----->  I guess I don’t need the %
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Ian Fraser Looks like it accomplishes the same thing, I was trying to avoid using two characters for each stat so your keyboard works exactly as I would want it to for that
David Busby  ----->  Oh on the topic of scouting people in the group for mystic players really me and Amanda should be able to easily tell from how much we raid 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I just remeber the name goes with what moveset. I basically only use  3 pokes anyways....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So @Daniel R , you were talking about adding trainer lvl to mystic chat? Is that correct? Or the big group
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mystic should b easy. Big group might b slow
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  All we have to do is change all of our names and everyone else will follow suit
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I was wondering how everyone felt about both. Might help to get to know everyone a little easier. Maybe easier to see mystic that have been playing for awhile and want to join a mystic chat where more than justvraids take place, gym control for instance.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im open to it. Valor and instinky dont have to follow.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If you don't see where someone changes there name being funny a week later I may not know you anymore. And I don't mind raiding with all. But if 6 mystic are on the way I can join them. 
Amanda  ----->  Sooo Amanda•MzzMystic•M40????
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wait, @Keaton Rhea you know that almost everyone in the main chat has their trainer level attached, right? 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You know what I mean...lol. ofcource dost help when you scroll back and see jazz in the chat.......again....lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I know that. He wants just use to say M40 instead of 40
Amanda  ----->  Most have trainer name too now.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Icons work well
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  ❄️
Amanda  ----->  But the whale... 🐋 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Ken can keep his stupid whale, I don’t recognize it’s authority 
Ian Fraser  ----->  The whale is forever tainted 
Amanda  ----->  😂😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  🦈
Amanda  ----->  💧❄️
Amanda  ----->  Adam once said💦, and I said hell no.
Sam Kawell  ----->  It should be done ice thing because of Articuno imp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That last one amanda has been abused sexually. 
Amanda  ----->  I’m completely with Sam and Taylor. I was just rocking the boat.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Just make sure you put it at the end of your name if you do it or else it’s a pain to tag you 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  But I don't want to be the snowflakes.....lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  🌊
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  RIDE THE WAVE
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What the
Ian Fraser  ----->  Actually I like that, brb
Amanda  ----->  💎
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Ooooh, icy
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  The blue diamonds...sounds like odd wrestling tag team...lol
Amanda  ----->  🔹🔹there is this too
Amanda  ----->  @Daniel R You can’t suggest then be so damn picky. Lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Lol....the strong are made me laugh as I was berrying some poor causal for the ?????time today 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Alright y'all I have to put you guys on mute. How's a fella supposed to get any work done.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell but you miss the new hair cuts!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Okay tagging me just cheating.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Even if it's for adorable hair cuts
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha im done. Go back to work
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  A blue emoji does stick out. We can be what ever symbol i just like giving @Amanda a hard time but that might lead to a more united group.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You know he's about to ask somebody....lol
Amanda  ----->  It’ll actually help the ones that aren’t in the Mystic group get with Mystic people to raid.
Cindy R  ----->  Have mercy! That was a lot to catch up on. And I am not sure any actual decisions were made other than avoid kento. LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R TLDR: I think we want to do the bame changes in both big group and mystic. Big consensus is avoid ken like the plague. If we get cornered, add and give him strict rules.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Name changes.... Not bame lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I sent a msg out to big mystic.... Will it get read? Who knows
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Maybe david can figure out a bot for our mystic chat? Automate the msg when we add new folks
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Idk how that works at all
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I spy dumpster fire... You will never guess who....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  3 accounts are in this chat. 3 accounts are kentoo.
David Busby  ----->  Yes and someone needs to be careful about what time they’re out at Sam Harris 
David Busby  ----->  You know who you are. Try to stay safe 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes for sure! No sam harris after dark.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Going to guess the bagon, Beldum, and larvitar are @Keaton Rhea , @Amanda and @David Busby ?
David Busby  ----->  2/3
David Busby  ----->  No Amanda 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Figured the larvitar was Amanda 😂
Amanda  ----->  No me.
Michelle U  ----->  Yes Amanda stop going to Sam Harris late 😛
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Phil?
Amanda  ----->  ^^^^ culprit
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Or is it you Michelle lol
Michelle U  ----->  Haha it's me. Sometimes I drop after I leave school
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Y’all telling me you don’t want to farm Illumise candy?
Cindy R  ----->  @David Busby I love you pic!  I laugh every time I see it!
Michelle U  ----->  Maybe he thought we were going for a small and cute theme? 
David Busby  ----->  On one hand i wanna be relieved he somewhat gets themes but at the same time 🤦‍♂️
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Ralts would have been much better choice. So would have not dropping. 
Phil Pearson  ----->  I don’t go to that side of town
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Phil, you are welcome. Just not at night bc we care about our team members.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We discourage it to others... But cant stop it
Phil Pearson  ----->  I did a raid for the first time there last week 
Darren May  ----->  I’m fine with passing through at night to drop but I’m not going to battle the gym 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sam harris is my baby. Don't let anyone take it easy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Darren, im more concerned with drunk drivers. Our street is awful with reckless driving.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I see mail boxes going down near that intersection of foaster and pleasant ave. That is close to the party central
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Of foster and pleasant
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I feel safe living here. I have alarm system and bonus security.  I will still advise to never visit after dark. You may be sober but that loser down the st is not.
Darren May  ----->  I went in the daytime the other day and got my bearings. Some people from our church have a nonprofit called Our House that is on the corner of the street that comes out on Donahue so I’m actually around pretty regularly
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dream center? Or the one right off bedel?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Day time is nothing. School is out? Nothing but kids. Weekends. Its birthday party in afternoon. It's safe until dark, bc ive seen so many drug deals.  Daylight they do it. But they dont care. Night time the drugs get harder to get. Pls avoid.
Darren May  ----->  Bedell I think. It’s actually two houses with a semi abandoned house on between 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I saw that! That construction was in my way but I knew it was church related
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All white in a sea of not. It doesn't bother me and this is NOT a negative statement. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I am really happy for the dream center and this nee house coming here
Keaton Rhea  ----->  New house from darren's church
David Busby  ----->  Nope he’s never getting in
David Busby  ----->  He thinks Amanda’s perfect level 40 ogre is her only one
Phil Pearson  ----->  Ugh I was appraising things and I had 3 that were wonders and all three stats... but certainly impressed😑
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its the worst. Such a high, then hits you in the face like a sledge hammer
Cindy R  ----->  That's a perfect description!
Phil Pearson  ----->  It was oddish Baltoy and gastly. Nothing of importance but would’ve been nice to have a few more perfects
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gastly is da bomb tho! Sadly he is bad without SC. My perfect I caught way b4 the move change, but I didnt evo even tho I had candies. Much regrets there :/
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I had around 1k candies when they nerfed gengar. Now mine is stuck with hex
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Cue david salt gif...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Took him to the top instead. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  GORt install first? 
David Busby  ----->  Yea I feel like jazzys gonna get added
Ian Fraser  ----->  Then sure, just don’t want Mystic destroyed lol. 
David Busby  ----->  Oh and she won’t remove but she might add someone who will
Ian Fraser  ----->  Don’t think GORT takes too long to set up but you have to do it. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea that’s what I was thinking. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What stop it no drinking and adding jazz
Ian Fraser  ----->  Not drinking, trying to avoid JimmiStorm starting a campaign in the big group to add Kento
David Busby  ----->  So in another group Rachel(jimmi storm) is trying to campaign to add jimmi and kentoo to mystic and I countered with let her in for 24 hours just don’t bring up kentoo
Amanda  ----->  Can’t believe ya’ll are caving to her blackmail...we have control.
David Busby  ----->  Y’all are the ones who want to add kentoo if he asks to get added
David Busby  ----->  I’m standing by over my cold dead body
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay but we should probably GORT up mystic at some point regardless..
Amanda  ----->  Agree with @Ian Fraser . Busby drinks with the enemies too much. 😁
David Busby  ----->  Um you live with the enemy

Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If she is in the group then it's basically jazzy's group.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wrong group lol 
David Busby  ----->  So I can ban jazzy but to do it I have to re add...
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  He won’t notice he’s been added if you do it quick
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Can try to keep him occupied in another group
Darren May  ----->  There is literally no way this can end badly (sarcasm font)
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Pro tip: You can shorthand with /s
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Reddit speak for sarcasm
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Amanda why your sudden Exodus?
Amanda  ----->  Prepping the spare room for the kids, and it’s hard with my FOMO and constant chat checking 😔
Amanda  ----->  Why do they insist on trying to call us out about ex gym control when we don’t even try?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You guys realize that is me I carroll car? Im solo burning max revives at gym lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, I have cookies FYI
Cindy R  ----->  Is there an ex today?  I haven't been following the chat today
Amanda  ----->  Yes. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda if you want to go for gym control for next EX, then we can. Just gotta make sure all the big dogs want to participate
Amanda  ----->  I really just want to hush them, but I’m fine either way. Let’s see what we can do.
Cindy R  ----->  If anyone has Felton on the 29th we would be up to give it a shot.  It's a Sunday so would be able to get there early. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive got my clefable, max bliss, and resources to power up obscure things haha. Just let me know
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im guessing lvl 40 Frank is my best bet to sammich in there between a fat bliss and chan/lax
Ian Fraser  ----->  I can push a 98% Gardev to the top. Not positive I could make it to drop in but I could try. 
Amanda  ----->  🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess our best best is to list what we got for top tier defenders and how to place them... Well I guess we will panic if push comes to shove haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Big 3, maybe clefable, then 2 more. Haryiama, lapras, dnite, metagross are some other things ive seen.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I have a level 40 98IV lapras 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Agrron is not bad but I hat stacking fighting weakness
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lapras is tough. Lvl 40 vap is bad news too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I know darren has extra thicc girl, but I can use mine. I prefer to save that for someone else but frank wants to play some
Amanda  ----->  I have a perfect lvl 40 Hariyama. Also the lvl 40 perfect dragonite 
Amanda  ----->  Is Darrens perfect Vaperon at 40?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Who has top bliss? Thicc gril gotta lead
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This the best I got
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Back up
Sam Kawell  ----->  Come on noobs, I got this
Cindy R  ----->  Here are my big ones.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok sam leads
Cindy R  ----->  Got this one too.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Cindy than chansey might b the best of our group!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or amanda has fo go one up everyone.....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Always...lol
Amanda  ----->  I also have a perfect lvl 29 Aggron I can take to the top.
Amanda  ----->  😔. Ya’ll have taught me well...
Cindy R  ----->  I got this guy...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Always willing to assist 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think a core of amanda chan, daniel get an extra thicc bliss, cindy aggron, my clefable, fill in with vap? Rando good 6th?
Amanda  ----->  @Sam Kawell Did Adam ever you show you his lvl1 shiny dragonite?
Amanda  ----->  I told him you’d love it!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Idk if he is lvl one haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  147CP haha
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I have to admit I was disappointed when they changed the CP's, he was a 3100cp
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Amanda he did!
Sam Kawell  ----->  And I don't have a good one, but I know steelix is a good defender.
Sam Kawell  ----->  It's hard to get a good tanky defender that doesn't take super effective damage from machamp
Sam Kawell  ----->  And here is my sparky
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I just swept idral team solo today with just 4 champs. Its more about time to win and how many goldens used
Amanda  ----->  I have a 98 Steelix I can top out.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ideal team... Typing bad
Michelle U  ----->  I got the anchor right here😉
Sam Kawell  ----->  Jelly
Amanda  ----->  We could use this Chansey I have too...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My ppse is better
Amanda  ----->  Your Chansey looks like it’s saying 🤗twinz!!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gotta make em dance b4 the selfie
Sam Kawell  ----->  Plz stop with that Chansey. You guys are making me too jealous. This is my best
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The real winner is the one who scrolls through all 3 faces of chansey! Turly captures her nature
Amanda  ----->  I was trying to figure out what ppse was and realized pose.
Michelle U  ----->  I like that even tho these are so weak, we still all have them starred😅 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pose. Yes. You are a great  decipher
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Don't wanna lose them! They are precious
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ph ripp mine chan is not star'ed. Fixed!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ohh*
Sam Kawell  ----->  PSA: make sure your phone is turned off before putting it in your pocket after showing off you're precious level 1s. I almost leveled up one of them and was saved because I didn't have any candy.
Sam Kawell  ----->  And my brother just showed me his best lvl 1. I need this.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Are people kidding with there questions?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lvl 26....
Darren May  ----->  Late to the party but I’m not sure if I’ll be able to participate in the ex raid gym defense. I do have a 98 blissey and the 100 vaporeon though. My past experience at ex raids suggests that the most important aspect is just having multiple people to golden berry. It’s almost impossible to take an actively defended gym without shenanigans.  In my opinion it’s not really worth the use of resources spent for a couple of balls and “bragging rights”, especially with mewtwo’s high catch rate.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  TLDR dank quests on campus. Rare candy: arb, billy hitchcock, waterfall. Ingram hall is larv. Ditto golden razz waterfall 
Darren May  ----->  Meanwhile I have two hatch 5 egg quests weighing me down
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I just finished my second one today. If you want extra fun @Darren May , the arb stop has hatch 3 eggs for rare instead of the great throws one
Darren May  ----->  I’m getting Amanda levels of FOMO
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also a $4 chansey back in the camp ground of chewacla
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May you can always do the billy, waterfall rares really easy with your open slot. Its only 3 great curves in a row
Darren May  ----->  Hopefully I will get to play some tonight. Haven’t made much xp progress the past few days
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ready when needed
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nice!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby I am only at 56,245. Im guessing @Cindy R or @Daniel R are near or beyond that
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Right there with ya
David Busby  ----->  Jesus y’all got me doubled 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gotta catch em all david!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ours is about to improve though as we have been gold gym focused for a long time now. We only have 8 gyms to get gold in for all of auburn/Opelika 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah im not too focused on gyms normally. Just raids and star dust grinds
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Some How we have about the same number of caught. You always have stardust  and I never have any...lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha I tend to only power up what I like and some of the top meta pokes. Im usually limited by rares or candies of rare species
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby All that empty xp
David Busby  ----->  I’m not gonna lie there’s only one or two 40s in Auburn weaker than me
David Busby  ----->  Oh and Pete, but Pete could have a good account if he actually powered up. Oh and same with Adriel 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also only have 25 lvl 40 pokes. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Tech vic and?
David Busby  ----->  Narco
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ohh ok
David Busby  ----->  Well I’ve never been in his account but what I’ve heard from storm isn’t great
Keaton Rhea  ----->  From what he places in gyms, I would have to agree
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R im just not a fan of the 1 power up club. I wait until I have all I need to take my poke to where I want. Only focus on a select few at a time
Michelle U  ----->  "Only 25 lvl 40".... I don't even have one !!! 😆
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well the next two I want might require a butt load of rares I dont have
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess I can finish off my 6 champs
Cindy R  ----->  I use my stardust as quick as I get it...lol
Michelle U  ----->  I try to Also! My problem is getting enough stardust :(
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just keep catching @Michelle U ! It will build up
Michelle U  ----->  And this event is definitely helping😃
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes 3x on majority of the pokes is great. Plus the catch trick makes dust flow
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wait... Help for that low a tier of raid? Did I miss something?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  How hard is it to squash a bug. I know she could do it
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So is stamina important?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes and no. @Sam Kawell could prob explain it better, but I think they are additive like the main series. So a 10 IV adds 10 HP
Sam Kawell  ----->  Not quite. All Pokemon stats are calculated with the same formula (Base Stat + IV)*CPM where CPM is a measure of the pokemon's level. So the iv doesn't quite add that simply. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  And defense and HP are of the same importance in the damage calculation, so in a rough way, you can just average the defensive and hp ivs to get a good idea of the total survivability.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess it is more complicated in this game. I forgot about CPM
Darren May  ----->  And I was just going to make an inappropriate “stamina” joke. Good job guys
David Busby  ----->  Yea my 100% ttar and 15/15/14 ttar have the same hp so my 98 is basically another hundred
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I forgot to mention the floor function
Keaton Rhea  ----->  For those who don't got time to scroll up on othee chat or are just about to get off work. Foy hall, auburn chappel, Finks, auburn colosseum all have rare quests. Ditto for goldens at amphitheatre. Also machop at tichneor hall (next to haley) and little residence (upper quad near cater lawn)
Cindy R  ----->  Thanks!!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R @Daniel R hatch 3 eggs for a rare quest I got earlier today
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You find all the good stops.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I spin a lot of stops haha. That was only good one today.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also hear of some others from storm chat when at work bc of Chase
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rouse across from prices BBQ is 3 greats in a row for 3 rares.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R @Daniel R this stop if you didnt get it already
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We will hit them on the way back through thanks
Cindy R  ----->  Thanks @Keaton Rhea we'll have to swing by there tonight.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok just getting up put a pic so you know what stop!
Cindy R  ----->  Fyi....nothing out in the B'gard area at all . Lol. Out at spring villa for a boy scout awards ceremony.  Was hoping to find a hidden gym. Lol
Phil Pearson  ----->  Jesus. Anthony is already at Felton 
Cindy R  ----->  That is insane...lol.
Darren May  ----->  He has been quiet lately. Must have been saving his berries for this
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He had been working on sam harris, zion, boykin. That might b why you have not seen him as much
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He dropped a 3.2k bliss and 1.4k chansey a few days ago
Darren May  ----->  Makes sense. I was hoping he had his priorities in order and was preparing for the end of the semester 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha not sure he is ready... He was dumping goldens into his mons just to keep the topped off like once every few hrs
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess no point in us trying for gym control. Just take our 12 balls and call it good
David Busby  ----->  Yea I’m dedicated but not obsessed 
Cindy R  ----->  I agree! 
Cindy R  ----->  😂😂😂😂😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Why :/
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pls stop
Cindy R  ----->  He has an instinct act al gore past as high as his mystic...we could NEVER trust his loyalty! 
Cindy R  ----->  What did my auto correct do!
Cindy R  ----->  *instinct aacout
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm gonna tell kentoo to buy @David Busby some beer so he'll slip up and let him in lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Good luck @Daniel R 
Amanda  ----->  I can’t 😣😣
Cindy R  ----->  Ok bad joke...its been a way bigger pain in the but for you guys.  ☹
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm kind of surprised that he hasn't asked one of us in person yet to join the GroupMe. His loss I guess.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm also very certain he wouldn't renounce his multi-accounting ways anyway
Darren May  ----->  Who says he hasn’t asked? 😂
Darren May  ----->  He asked the other day if the mystic groupme was still a thing and I told him to talk to David and get in the nc-17 group
David Busby  ----->  You were the mole???
David Busby  ----->  That group lit up when he said something about nc 17
Ian Fraser  ----->  The real mole was the friends we made along the way. 
Darren May  ----->  I think he would make a good addition 
Darren May  ----->  Honestly it may be worth it to add him to mystic just so he will quit calling out raids at blue gyms in the main group so early
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes but then he will be spaming the mystic chat...
Darren May  ----->  I guess that is a risk/reward analysis 
Darren May  ----->  Which changes for me depending on when I last had a personal interaction with him 
Michelle U  ----->  He has access to a good cart apparently. Campis mystic uber? 🤔
Michelle U  ----->  *golf cart
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It would put david out of business!
Darren May  ----->  Pass
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh ill never use it haha
Darren May  ----->  Maybe over the summer I’ll figure out how to use the University bike share
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May which stops do you spin on way in? Apparently leslie found a catch a dragon for 3 rare and she thinks it was AU hotel.....
Ian Fraser  ----->  Pretty sure it’s not. I spun the hotel on the way in too. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well she drove from library to AISC. I know its not on campus
Darren May  ----->  Didn’t spin many this morning as I already had 2 1500 dust quests
Ian Fraser  ----->  I walked from Prices to the bookstore and crossed college at Thach. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Could be on College between Thach and Mag? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive covered every stop around dixie bib and amphitheater. Ao not there. I did all of them on college from thatch to mag from the road.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Could b on the side of 1865 bc I didn't cross st
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Idk if rouse is accessible from road but it had a good one a few days ago 
Darren May  ----->  Hmm, could be corner of Thach and Chewacla stop. I may have to dump something to complete a quest today
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes that is possible. Is comer possible to spin from the road?
Darren May  ----->  No on rouse and comer I think. Unless she went through a parking lot 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ah ok I dont think she did. 
Cindy R  ----->  Anyone know where that mount olive gym is? We couldn't find it the other day.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I do not know where that gym is. But I know where some good quests are!
Sam Kawell  ----->  I know I'm late to the party, but Leslie did not take a direct route to AISC. She dropped into Wells Fargo and Vaporcraft on her way.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Moes southwest near downtown is win a tier 3 or higher for rare. First pres student center is 7 super for rare. Bells Baptist is ditto for 3 rares
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And I guess a big fat RIP for the dragon quest leslie found. She was not sure where she got it
Darren May  ----->  😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Omg.  Ok I guess I was wrong
Darren May  ----->  So interesting mystery...I was talking to a casual at church tonight and she couldn’t log into her account. Niantic said it was a glitch and restored her account. It is her same player name but her pokes are different. Her Pokédex took a hit but it’s wild what she has now. Rows of high cp (she is level 32) ttars and dragonites all named after their movesets. I just scrolled through quickly but there was a 💯 slaking, ttar, snorlax. Anyone heard of something like that?
David Busby  ----->  Sounds like she just got the account of a banned spoofer...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That's what it sounds like.  From what I've been reading about the spoofing/spoofer issues they have always sold/or given old temporary banned accounts to legit players in hopes that after the account has been played legit that all bans would be lifted.
David Busby  ----->   I’m thinking more that they tried to restore her account but bungled what account she got 
Darren May  ----->  Weird
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sounds like they did give her a previously banned spoofer account on accident...that or someone somewhere is about to be realllyyy pissed. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well that person is prob perma banned so they will never know
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sounds really odd tho. Means they had a lvl 32 legit player in a similar category as full on spoofer
Darren May  ----->  I’d like to investigate further but she doesn’t want any problems from niantic and would keep this account. Can’t say I blame her
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She def should not say anything
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just keep it
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What's your preference for medagross? Attack or gym defender? Movesets?
David Busby  ----->  Steel type attacker for fairies. Throw him in a gym so people see I have a level 40 metagross🤷‍♂️ he suffers from very not good movesets. But hell hopefully get his signature move meteor mash at some point 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May I ran some numbers on the regi golem trio... And we gonna have a bad time for raids on campus this summer
Darren May  ----->  I was afraid of that. What are the best counters? I’m afraid my team isn’t as ready for this as I was for latios/latias 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ice, steel, rock are golems types. Champ is safe bet, but moltres, flareon, kyogre are to tier DPS
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We were hitting almost 20DPS with lati@s and ray
Darren May  ----->  🤔😬Flareon better than entei
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh yeah and blaziken is meta
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And cheap
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also keep in mind that this is raw DPS. Does not take jnto account survivability
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Catie will be on campus. And I’ll probably force her to log in for me on occasion so I don’t lose the chance at them completely in B’ham
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ill keep catie in mind. But did you look at numbers? Worse than lugia I think (off top of head)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, keep in mind of distance soft ban if you do that.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just for you @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  Nice but now I feel dumb bc I thought it was shiny theme but that is a normal glalie 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m not 100% of what I’m looking at numbers wise compared to Latios/Ray?

But yea I know. I figure I can probably afford to be w/o the game for a couple hours. Work + looking at maps it looks like B’ham has in the entire city the amount of stop AU has just on campus. 
Cindy R  ----->  LOL, Darren we did the same thing. 😂😂😂
David Busby  ----->   @Daniel R @Cindy R be prepared to berry Felton 
David Busby  ----->  Instinct is trying to take the whole town and they’re headed that way
Cindy R  ----->  Ugh..we are also trying to hang onto tigerbench.  We kicked sabi out on the way home.  
Cindy R  ----->  Do you need Felton? 
David Busby  ----->  I just wanna piss off storm
Cindy R  ----->  Sounds like mystic needs a gym night...its been a while since we have done it.  We are gold everywhere..LOL
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Almost everywhere.....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  One round of golden razz and then have up.....not very storm like @David Busby 
Amanda  ----->  😢kentoo...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh my... :/
Darren May  ----->  Its funny bc he spams the chat so much I had to read through for a couple of minutes to figure out what Leslie was talking about
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  At least I wasn't alone.lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Darren May I see you joined us at Mary olive, if your looking for another there is one spit left at the Opelika sports plex that we are trying to hold.
Darren May  ----->  Thanks. I got lucky on Mary olive bc I had a dentist appointment that morning and I was out and about. I doubt I will ever make it to the sportsplex but thanks for the headsup 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  When david gets up haha
Amanda  ----->  He said over his cold dead body... He’s probably close enough. I told him if he added Storm to Mystic. I was adding Ken. I think he is possibly getting better anyway, and now he knows all his bad habits. His choice to change, but I don’t think he needs kicked unless he doesn’t listen 🤷🏻‍♀️
Sam Kawell  ----->  Haha, and I think Bob needs rule #3 himself.
Amanda  ----->  Crickets 🦗 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I haven’t noticed that much but you’re right. Bob does keep it basically strictly raid chat though 
Amanda  ----->  I feel like the dropping 2 when you take down the gym is fair too. Also, easily explains why there is no issue with Ole’ Huck 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Can someone translate what he just said?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah thought that was a clever rule.
Amanda  ----->  @Ian Fraser Nope. Lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  ....
Amanda  ----->  We can explain Sam Harris to him later after he drops boo boo again. Don’t want to overwhelm him. Lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You have tuff love rules on this happy Friday...lol
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I’ve only spent 5 minutes looking at mystic group in the last 5 days and I want to kick C West
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  He’s 10x worse than what I thought Ken would be
Ian Fraser  ----->  Idk Kento is pretty bad. Maybe we should actually get them to fight like they were about to this morning and the winner stays. 
David Busby  ----->  You motherfucker @Amanda 
David Busby  ----->  I got in storm last night 
David Busby  ----->  That should even it out
Phil Pearson  ----->  Lol
Amanda  ----->  Nope.
David Busby  ----->  Should I make him an admin?
David Busby  ----->  Cause we all know what I great admin he’d be and I heard a spot just opened up
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I just read through this morning and he was getting on my nerves. Really doesn’t matter to me much though because I barely check these groups anymore 😒
Amanda  ----->  West or Ken?
Amanda  ----->  West annoyed me too, but I annoy me sometimes 🤷🏻‍♀️
Cindy R  ----->  This shouldn't make me laugh so much.....and Heeyyy @Taylor Pruitt !!
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Amanda West. But not as much as your avatar photo annoys me 😬

And hey @Cindy R !
Amanda  ----->  I like it! It’s left over from avenjins 😁
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I know of 3 gyms that got removed over time, bike shop, the one on Farmville road and Lakeview. Are there any odd far out gyms we dontbknow about?
Amanda  ----->  Those are the only ones I know of.
Amanda  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt For you😁, but still rtr 🤗
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Does Beauregard have Any gyms?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Ian Fraser first rule of sam harris is not to talk about sam harris
Darren May  ----->  I’ve also been in support of adding kentoo and letting him learn to conform or being kicked out naturally. However I’m very happy this is happening while I’m on vacation and I have all the groups muted
Amanda  ----->  Thanks for checking in on us though! Enjoy your Vitamin D😁
Darren May  ----->  This is the only one I don’t have muted so when I woke up and saw all these messages I had to investigate. Imma need @Keaton Rhea to give me a summary of each chat at the end of the day like he does for the good quests
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha am I the book keeper now? @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  Well you do such a good job with the quest recaps
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was just giving you a hard time. I will actually b leaving for beach tomorrow morning
Darren May  ----->  Good job on coordinating our vacations so that we won’t miss out on campus raids together 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I planned it that way!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May TLDR. Kento did well today. Did not see him in person but didn't spam chat and didnt place a bunch. I surpassed 60k total caught today. Most importantly, sam is a dad!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And tech vic is still shady as can be.
Amanda  ----->  He is just REALLY REALLY socially awkward.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes kento, not tech vic. 
Amanda  ----->  Both, but tech Vic is more actually.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess. But in diff ways. Kento is innocent
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You see only the good in ppl, Amanda. Its refreshing. I cant do that all the time. If not I keep my mouth shut.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  So any of y’all think Ken went back through the group and saw all the things we said about him?
Cindy R  ----->  That would be terrible....
Ian Fraser  ----->  (a) I don’t think he has the attention span

(b) I think most of the discussion regarding him has been kept to only this Gm 
Cindy R  ----->  I don't know...he is a little weird. 
Cindy R  ----->  Anybody know who this is?
Amanda  ----->  That’s why I wanted this chat, so we didn’t seem like such buttholes if we added anyone after we gave an unpleasant opinion of them in Mystic chat that they could read later. I felt we could be honest in here with each other about our opinions 🤷🏻‍♀️
Amanda  ----->  But there is definitely stuff about kennydubbue in Mystic chat
David Busby  ----->  Well as far as I’m concerned he’s your problem 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If you need someone to let kentoo  know he's being....... insert your favorite word.....let me know. I don't mind saying it.
Ian Fraser  ----->  So it seems that military bases are weird. The one Catie’s dad works at has stops/gyms/and spawns. But the Lakehurst Naval base in NJ has stop/gyms/but absolutely no spawns
David Busby  ----->  Can Leslie really not solo a gengar?
Amanda  ----->  I can “solo” a ttar, but still call it.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I would call out what we do in the morning but it's just sad....houndour=4t raid.
Cindy R  ----->  I honestly think leslie just likes the people aspect. Seeing and talking to others. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I agree with you cindy. She loves the social aspect of the game. I dont think she even considers solo play as far as raids are concerned. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There seems to be two ways to play. The guy who makes/reads spreadsheets, break points, and creates full meta teams and knows type chart by heart. Then the one that just doesnt care and they want to socialize.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Both are welcome as far as I am concerned
Amanda  ----->  Then there is me that likes to read said spreadsheets then cultivate strong Poké’s, so I can have bad (in a good way like Leslie uses)Pokémon to raid with while I socialize!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Amanda, you are very meta when you wanna be!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Guys... Kento just gym sniped sam harris from pete and is not even doing the raid
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Gym bully.......i approve 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He posted it too. Ken doing good
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I don't think we made an official statement but I'll wait to do main group we Cindy feels better. But we are officially finished with all auburn and Opelika gyms....gold everywhere. Now when we take gyms it will be for the satisfaction...lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like that. I still mostly only hit my  golds during day just for coins. Ive branched out and hit my total pokes in gym limit. Makes me sad bc I forgot that was a thing
Keaton Rhea  ----->  How many is that @Daniel R @Cindy R ? Like 100?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Only 91. We have several in Montgomery half way through silver but we have always dumped gym trash. They now get to learn about real gym control and probably a few hundred golden razzes per week.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only 91... So casual about that number........
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im gym casual. If I get gold, I get gold. If not, eh whatever. Im more about rares. Pls gimme gimme. I need more strong pokes
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Now we aim to be like you. 2 million stardust coming right up.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im at a whooping 17
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gold gyms that is. I like to walk and catch
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im working on a diff milestone. It might take a few more weeks to reveal
Sam Kawell  ----->  Pretty sure I know what that is...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nuhh uhh!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You dont know sam... (prob do know)
Amanda  ----->  Has anyone raided with strifechaotic? He is 30 now and asking to be added to Mystic.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have not. Saw him in big group. Give it a try. He doesn't cheat as far as I know. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Very. Casual
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I've seen the name in a few gyms but not sure if I've met him. @Amanda 
David Busby  ----->  These are all dps at level 40 against Ho oh
Darren May  ----->  Dang, no love for all those high level vapes and Garys I have
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can double check on gary. Vap is not good. You really have to use that 4x weakness to rock
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Keep in mind that they will b behind kyogre at 6 on the list.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lvl 40 gary and vap are 12.6 and 11.5 DPS, respectively. At lvl 40
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May you can get the same DPS out of a sudowoodo as a similarly powdered up Gyarados.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sudowoodo OP
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If ttar ever gets a good rock quick move (smack down), he will b a monster
Sam Kawell  ----->  If they do that, I can finally stop labeling him as overrated in good conscience
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But he is too cool to b overrated!
Darren May  ----->  My golems are trash but basically they are still better than my high ivs high level water types?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yep. Golem will be the way to go regardless
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. And you only need to take them up to around 30 unless you want that last break point (which requires 15atk). Remember its just a half lvl higher to reach breakpoint with lower IVs. A 0 atk can reach the one at lvl 29
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well 29 for 15 atk
Darren May  ----->  I do have a 💯 sudowoodo I could max out. It’s like level 15 now. 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  Do it!
Ian Fraser  ----->  2️⃣🔝
Darren May  ----->  I might wait and see on that one. I’m planning on using my dust for the 💯 shiny ho-oh I’m going to catch 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You mean the TWO 100 shiny hooh you  catch? Im sure you got enough dust for two!
Amanda  ----->  @David Busby Guy who brought the popcorn was standing right there. That is why I said 🤫😁
David Busby  ----->  Sorry?
Phil Pearson  ----->  Of the 92 charmander caught today there was one ‘wonder’ 😑
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry Phil! :(
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R @Daniel R may I ask what your evolve badge looks like?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  5170 seems low
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby informed me of some wrong info...
David Busby  ----->  Oh sorry
David Busby  ----->  Y’all got me beat by a lot
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All my exp came from mass evo. Last I checked, im sitting in about 1M exp in candy that needs to be lucky egged to death
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  This puts me at like 29th on Facebook for Alabama 40s
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im so far behind!
Cindy R  ----->  My screen shot won't post...I have 5,850 evolved.  
Cindy R  ----->  Ha! I am ahead of Daniel! XP. 30859978
Phil Pearson  ----->  I did get this bad boy 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Some doggies got groomed today
Darren May  ----->  Nice round number. Completed my regional dex today with armaldo and cradilly 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I actually completed my regional dex today too with cradilly... Weird
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My regional is awful :/ so many things I have candies for but they have awful IVs
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only at 353 caught. Ive got like 13 I can finish soon. Only 2 need a few more candies.
Darren May  ----->  Impulse powerup @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looks like it was worth it!
Cindy R  ----->  Camo will be a t4 in 36 mins.  We turned it blue if anyone wants to do it.  We won't be able to.
Cindy R  ----->  Whoops. Wrong group.
Darren May  ----->  Long shot but any of those alolan versions meta relevant? Eggy maybe? Still hyped either way @Keaton Rhea 
Darren May  ----->  Oh electric type golem
David Busby  ----->  Ice fairy ninetales bro
Darren May  ----->  Stats aren’t great though. I’m reading a silph post about it now but I won’t trust anything until I hear from my math people 
David Busby  ----->  They didn’t change the stats drastically for any of the Pokémon. None of the alolan variants ended up on my final squad. Eggs are the only thing that might be semi meta 
Darren May  ----->  So just screwing with my dex right after I completed it? Same thing happened with gen 2. They came out the week after I finished gen 1
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah I dont think even eggs will be meta. Rat, sala, dnite, latios will all b better
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Majority of it will b dex filler
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dark/poison muk will prob b better than the original as a B/C tier defender. Alolan nine tails is only semi relevant in main series bc it got ability snow warning
David Busby  ----->  I forgot how hard I tried to get that hidden ability
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Easiest way is prob WT. Mass breed something you want that doesnt need HA. Then WT them all away. 99% will b trash, but eventually you will get some thing good after xfer of like 15 boxes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Anyone else been having stability problems since end of community day? Android users?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Tons of screen lock ups and now it just flat out crashes about 30 sec into launch
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive done fresh install and restarted my phone
Sam Kawell  ----->  I guess you can't play Pokemon go anymore.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :( but I can't stop
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well the app has spoken. It's no longer in your hands
Darren May  ----->  Unrelated but what is the rate for ho-oh hatching over latias? Everything is ho-oh, not that I mind
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It was reported to b 80/20 in favor of hooh initially. they swaped it and seems to b more of a 60/40 in favor of lati@s
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I've been having that on huckleberrys being on the older S6 phone.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im on a note5 so about that old
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Don't say that....so am i.  Lol. Mine has crashed some since the last update but usually when I first get started.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes my crashes occur right after start up. Like 30s at best, then crash and burn
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So I unistalled. Cleared ram. Restarted. Installed. No crashes right now. But ive only had it running about 5 mins
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This is the 3 time to reinstall
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She is never coming home! :(
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So not impressed with what chaos sherif puts into gyms im going for gold
David Busby  ----->  At that point why even drop
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He did it in almost all of them I can see him. Dunsparce was best one
Darren May  ----->  Strategy question: better to have one maxed gardevoir or two level 30-35ish?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Probably one maxed just to discourage people. Not like defense matters much and anytime it does(ex raid I guess?) you’ll want it to be a high as possible, right? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah defense doesn't matter anyway and particularly for Gardevoir which likely won't scare anyone off anyway. Personally I would choose two level 35s because they're each essentially just as useful as a 40. 
David Busby  ----->  Gardevoir scares me off more than a 3219 blissey
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ok @Keaton Rhea I'm trying to work on the star dust game but I'm sorry to report I only have 38 level 40's.
Darren May  ----->  Um 38 seems like a lot to me
Sam Kawell  ----->  But I don't think it'll make much difference if the Gardevoir is 2600 or 2800 cp
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I figured you all have all your tops topped out
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  My one and only
Darren May  ----->  Ooo gotta tm her to dazzling gleam
David Busby  ----->  I have 17 level 40 and I thought that was a lot 👀
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Done
Darren May  ----->  That will wreck some Machamps
Cindy R  ----->  Ok, I stopped counting...I have 55+ topped out.
Darren May  ----->  I was always of the opinion I’d rather have 2 level 30ish over 1 level 40 but now I’m getting jealous of you guys 40s
David Busby  ----->  Depends on what I’m using. Two level 37 rays for breakpoint instead of one level 40. But I’ve got one level 40 hariyama for shits and giggles
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I couldn't go down like that I had to recount/use some dust. Now I'm at 51 level 40s lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You got me beat by a mile. I dont even have to count @Daniel R 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There comes a point where you really dont need more lvl 30 versions of a top attacker, so lvl 40 is a better investment
Darren May  ----->  Should have calculated my candies a bit more. Stuck at 37.5 for my gardevoir
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Those last two power ups hurt the most
Darren May  ----->  I’m really regretting the 83% level 20 I evolved for the dex entry
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Awesome. Just what I wanted...
Darren May  ----->  I have the opposite problem. I got a 98 and a 96 from encounters that I have no candy for. Going to be hitting the pavement during adventure week
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ill take anything decent at this point. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Who are all these new players at the museum lol. I guess we've just been casuals.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Events bring out the filthy casuals. You guys are royalty
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Make them bow down to you!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im turning into you guys @Daniel R @Cindy R . I just spent 15 goldens on a gym I will not be doing a raid. 
Cindy R  ----->  Bahahha.....you gym bully
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It was semi coordinated atk for a T4. One guy followed the other 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I wonder how far back we would have to scroll to see @Keaton Rhea post about not taking gyms very often lol. Now being a bully like the rest of us.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  One man wrecking crew iw melting my items away haha @Daniel R 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Ian Fraser sorry I placed trash on your coins gym! I told the attacker to go away so you should b good haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looks like kento made a 4th account
Keaton Rhea  ----->  4 mystic that is
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There is a 4min gap between the other drops
Ian Fraser  ----->  Lol and he doesn’t even have any of his to 35 yet. Just why??
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I saw his post complaining some gyms never get filled. Well what good is that crap. That's the kind of thing an alt account gets created for Just to kick it out.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I have a pretty good time going in solo and placing 1 then calling out for drive by drop ins. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dare I do it?
Darren May  ----->  Pass
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I did. I would prefer to b done with vap craft tho. Only like 70% there
Darren May  ----->  I understand. I would leave it and hope it gets shaved out
Cindy R  ----->  Throw 10 regular berries at it for the gym points. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It was placed 10mins after my 2.9k bliss so it is second in line....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would rather throw my regular berries at sam harris! Its my berry lottery
Amanda  ----->  @David Busby Did something for real happen last night?
David Busby  ----->  Yes but I think Will is over it 
David Busby  ----->  They’re at least talking 
Amanda  ----->  Well dang. I feel bad now. He finally kicked me from Valor chat though 😁
David Busby  ----->  I mean there’s a reason I said something so anyone that wasn’t there wouldn’t say anything
Amanda  ----->  Okay...
David Busby  ----->  Not that you said anything bad but I felt like you were going to
David Busby  ----->  Just nevermind 
Amanda  ----->  Okay.
Cindy R  ----->  Anyone want to do 5t at museum...we are trying to hold them gym ...jazz and gang are trying to take it
Amanda  ----->  What time does it hatch @Cindy R ?
Cindy R  ----->  20 secs
Cindy R  ----->  Its ho oh
Cindy R  ----->  @Amanda you want to do.  There is a group here
Amanda  ----->  We can be there in 10-12, but you don’t have to wait if you don’t want to
Cindy R  ----->  We can wait
Amanda  ----->  Otw 
Cindy R  ----->  @Amanda eta
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Amanda i can still hear that girl tell her mom "if youbdont catch this ho oh your soul is dead to me". That's just too much pokemon stress lol.
Amanda  ----->  She was dramatically adorable.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If mav didn't see this I thought it was odd last night.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Who is jc?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Amanda 
Amanda  ----->  @Daniel R Good find. Idk
David Busby  ----->  I know none of them but that hunter kid was trying to keep up in late night raid chat
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Amanda I forgot this guy also shaved out a snorlax at Julie Collins this morning. So more of a reason to leave  him out.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I vote leave him out. He has shaved me out of sam harris twice now. I thought it was kento, but he left just his account and one of kento's
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I feel like this is old question but just how important is that 3rd stat?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  15/15/5
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They all matter if you want max CP. Overall, IVs don't matter much. The biggest thing is to look at atk IV only bc its more efficient to power up to breakpoints. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There are very few break points you will miss out on if you are going to 40
Darren May  ----->  Found this today. Will probably randomly repost over and over
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  My favorites happen to be those that require the least star dust/rare candy lol.
Cindy R  ----->  Battle gym 3 times for a rare.  It's in front of historic chapel
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda I can do tigef statute if you just need one more but ill need a ride. If not then no worries
Amanda  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I would, but Adam has to be back in 10 minutes😔
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok don't worry about it then! Sorry I guess we are some of the few that will do latias
Amanda  ----->  IKR. Thank you though. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Hey we'll still raid anything. The rare candy struggle is real.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im right there with you @Daniel R but I dont have a good latias or shiny hooh.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Same here and work always gets in the way.
David Busby  ----->  So Friday I think it was Leslie had ~250k dust and she’s now got 20k and I just really wanna know what she spent it on
Phil Pearson  ----->  Presumably something useless 
David Busby  ----->  Yea but what. Did she pull a Rachel and blow it on something she thinks cute or did she pull a Parker
Darren May  ----->  Maybe her mewtwo from yesterday. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My guess is the mewtwo as well. Don't know how she had that many rare bc It seems im always out!
GroupMe  ----->  Keaton Rhea added Matt Inger to the group.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hello Matt! This is a higher group of mystics that discuss advanced strategies and hadles any drama/politics that might arise.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Feel free to join us or if it ever becomes something you are not interested, then you are always free to leave or leave on perma-mute
David Busby  ----->  I’m just here for the spreadsheets 
Cindy R  ----->  Yep, just to soak up all of their wisdom and be jelly of @Keaton Rhea 's stardust...lol
David Busby  ----->  At the moment we should all be jealous of @Amanda 
David Busby  ----->  Let’s see it
Cindy R  ----->  Stardust and shinies!  Lol
David Busby  ----->  Nope
David Busby  ----->  Just wait 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I aint got nothing over Amanda in most of the key stats....
David Busby  ----->  Long story short Amanda sux
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No. Amanda is an awesome fan of the larv butt!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Makes sure she does not suck at all
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Amanda why so much salt lol.
Sam Kawell  ----->  C'mon @Amanda you're getting no STAB with that moveset. Get him to rock smash ancient power pls
Darren May  ----->  So I just soloed aerodactyl on Snookems account, who has no powered-up meta relevant Pokémon. If Leslie couldn’t solo it then @David Busby never has to worry about being the weakest level 40 in auburn
David Busby  ----->  At this point I have more fun soloing on my alt than pretty much damn near anything in this game 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Stop being stop anti social lol. And happy Friday 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Why did mav add that joben hubley back in?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Mav says he raided with Dee 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He said watch him closley. I talked to him about it in person. He has been showing up to raids, but we wi see
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R @Cindy R am I catching up at all or is it a lost cause? Lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You've been grinding.....and we've been casual. You may be a little ahead. I don't think I've hit 31 yet.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive not even been doing enough raids. I wish I could do more! Need rares
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its mostly evos right after/b4 a raid
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This has inc a good bit
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So close
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I went from 8.8k pidgey candies down to 7.5k
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dang more evos it is!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im catching tons of trash bc I want the quest gold medal first and rare quests for mewtwo. Then I will grind some more
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I new I was saving some pidgies for something lol. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  My new personal quest....stay ahead of you 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Uh oh im in trouble haha
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And you got me by 2000 there
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My raids are very sad so I dont get much exp there
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm 305 so were the same there 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh wow
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I expected more. I guess work hinders you guys
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pokes caught? Im at 63.2k
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im curious what the diff is
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  247 on regular raids. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  126 regular raids. I only do those now to help lower lvls out now
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  60500 caught 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So near the same there... Hmm
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Egg hatches? Im at 1,716
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm not sure the exp we were getting on the ace trainer at 3500
Keaton Rhea  ----->  44,234 poke stops spun?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Oh eggs hatched.......damn.....3100
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ohh that might be part of it. Only at 1,125 ace trainer.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah there it is. Its eggs. I don't buy or use incubators. All single except for special events
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I get the most out of them tho!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Only 2650
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And here I am playing cards with family you could be gaining as we speak lol 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope cooking dinner for the wife!
Cindy R  ----->  Ha! Ahead of both of you....😝
Daniel just said I cant play while he drives anymore..hahaha. @Keaton Rhea @Daniel R 
Cindy R  ----->  But Daniel's right we have been very casual,  life has been crazy lately btw my Dad, our niece, and good old work. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I fear what is to come when your not 'casual'
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Fun fact. Paw poke has started to golden his defenders in the morning
Cindy R  ----->  Lol, poor paw paw...everyone knocks him out. 
Cindy R  ----->  Legit or spoof?
David Busby  ----->  Legit I called him out on it
David Busby  ----->  He’s actually one of the only storm that catches only for himself
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I guess I missed the drama in the main.
David Busby  ----->  Brad pissed me off in a separate group cause he kicked me just to piss me off
Darren May  ----->  #toomanygroups
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Darren May you mean when you show up to a raid hoping to have enough to find 13 already in the lobby lol.
Darren May  ----->  Storms coming as they say
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yaaaasss
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Demon aron!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Have those been used for mass evo? @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yup.
Sam Kawell  ----->  And pretty good IVs too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  2 the top! Make it the auto selection beats he wants to be!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Beast**
Sam Kawell  ----->  Not until 40
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Fine fine. Poor little aron gotta wait
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  No aron candies......thats sad times
Sam Kawell  ----->  So Mewtwo was duoed this morning. I'm pretty sure some of you guys could do it too if you got lucky with the fog weather
https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/8ormdb/mewtwo_duo_with_fog_boost/?utm_source=reddit-android
David Busby  ----->  Can you figure out why he names his stuff 60 or 80 cause I can’t 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I couldn't. Do you know what the three letters at the beginning mean?
David Busby  ----->  Ivs f is 15 e is 14 d is 13 and so on and so forth
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ah. And here is the explanation for 80
David Busby  ----->  Ooo that’s actually a decent idea
David Busby  ----->  So what legendary would we be completely unprepared for if it were to drop right after Ho oh @Keaton Rhea 
David Busby  ----->  Like how everyone got screwed by blizzard ogre 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We'll all the regis are weak to champ so we are safe there
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We are safe. Casuals are f*****
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its gotta be that or a combo of the ones we already had
David Busby  ----->  Ok and what are the next set of raids that will be a pain. Dialga and palkia?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think gen2 dogs are set for quests
David Busby  ----->  Yea that only makes sense although I would take being able to raid raikou again
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dialga (dragon steel) palkia (dragon water) and the ray ray equivalent us giratina (dragon ghost)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Prob champ vs dialga, maybe groudon. Tough typing to go up off head. Palkia dragons duh. Giratina might get hit hard by mewtwo, but my guess is dragons again.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Prob is steel resists dragon. Plus he is a monstrr stat wise
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But regis are prob next. They will suck donkey b.... They have great def so its gonna take big parties
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like lugia, except they do not do dmg back so you cant get charge moves to charge fast enough
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Y am I the living pokedex? I thought @David Busby @Darren May have played since launch?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But fun fact. Dialga controls time. Palkia controls space. giratina is in control of distortions world. A place where time and space to not flow.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And giratina has an alt form where his atk and defs swap
Sam Kawell  ----->  Whenever I see you say giratina I briefly misread it as girafarig and get pretty confused.
David Busby  ----->  I’m knowledgeable about gens 1-3 and the pokes in sun and moon but other than that I’m clueless. Plus you know all this way better than me @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im not the all knowing, but I guess im one of the few who hid the fact that I played my whole life, even after it was cool.
David Busby  ----->  Nah it’s still cool the others just don’t know what cool is lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive been telling my self since 1998..... I dont think I can say it's still true hahaha
Darren May  ----->  I only played gen 1&2. Everything else is a fun surprise for me. Snookems knows more about the rest than I do
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Keaton Rhea well hopefully executor on your list will get the job done 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I will need to check, but eggs in sun might b better than rai
Darren May  ----->  I’m really turning into a casual now. I have almost zero interest in researching and maximizing my kyogre team(s). I’m just gonna roll up with venusaurs and hope we got numbers. 
Darren May  ----->  And no blizzard 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But where is the fun in that? I thought you were a pokemon master?
Amanda  ----->  It’s because this is the 3rd time we’ve seen Kyogre 
Darren May  ----->  That was only fun for me when we were trying to trio latios. Is there a similar goal for kyogre?
David Busby  ----->  I’m gonna be honest I’ve had the groups on mute all day just chilling at the house and I’m off so I feel you 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  T5 raids are 300 sec right?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Then kyogre is not a hard trio in sun it appears. Just eggs and vena all it takes.
David Busby  ----->  Btw so is kyogre the only thing coming out of t5 or are hos still popping
Darren May  ----->  I’m reasonably excited about kyogre I guess. Preferable than the Regis to me but I guess I’m in some sort of feedback loop. Yesterday I was ready for the event to end bc I wanted a break. Then this morning I hated it bc it was back to trash everywhere. Then with today’s announcement I’m tired again already. #FirstWorldPogoProblems
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I just want my pink whale. That is what im more excited about
Amanda  ----->  Ho-oh goes away today.
David Busby  ----->  So I’ve got a bunch of eggys at like 32. Should I just finish them all off? They’re all already at breakpoint 
David Busby  ----->  Also why are the breakpoints feel like they’re under 30. Used to seeing last breakpoints at like 36
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Break point lvl is highly dependant on base dmg bc of rounding
Keaton Rhea  ----->  High base dmg like DT, high break pt. Low base dmg like bite, low break pt
David Busby  ----->  I’m guessing ogres defense isn’t helping
Amanda  ----->  PSA
I have noticed a few “alt” accounts that troll some of the other Pokémon trainers in a rather mean way. I was always taught that if you don’t like someone you don’t have to be around them. I was also taught to stand up for myself and others, but not to demean or cut other people down when doing it. If you are or know the person that’s doing just let them know it’s not funny even if you are their friend and are trying to be funny. So just do the right thing and stop. 

Post in big group or no?? Also, I miss last summer. 
David Busby  ----->  No they’ll just go after you next. It’s cause I called out about jazzyjihad
Amanda  ----->  But I’m not threatening like you were. 🤷🏻‍♀️ I don’t care if they do either. I guess they could really call me out on Adam, but o’well 
Cindy R  ----->  I totally missed what happened. ...its suprising how mean some folks are..I guess it takes all kinds of kinds...
David Busby  ----->  This is what she’s talking about btw 
Amanda  ----->  And jazzyjihad 
Cindy R  ----->  Oh Wow!!! Do we know who they are?
David Busby  ----->  Oh I’m 99% sure I know
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Who?
David Busby  ----->  Techvic
Amanda  ----->  Idk
Amanda  ----->  If it is him, he definitely wouldn’t mess with me for saying something.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would guess that, but I still have many doubts
Cindy R  ----->  I am speechless...that's horrible.
Amanda  ----->  I would also think one of the storm trying to be funny.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It's not
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well the two have tageted storm member and mystic member.. It points to valor
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It needs to be posted in the big group. I can if need be and I won't be nice about it.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Idk if it should go in big group. They are getting a buzz off the attention. Lets lay low and try to figure it out
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  If yall need someone to lay the hammer down just @ me 👌🏼
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Can’t hit what you can’t see 🤷🏻‍♂️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dont want to point fingers until we got hard evidence
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Also...what is Niantic doing if they can’t pick up on that name and recognize profanity?!?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They have zero filters. It's all based on reporting....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That's what I was thinking 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive seen many like it in HSV
Keaton Rhea  ----->  main series already has a filter list in all languages... Seems like they should use it
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  People being AH's bothers me when you know all ages can see that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I cant even name my trainer kakarot. That is the sayian name of goku from dragonball, means carrott lol. Idk what language it is a bad word in?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I agree @Daniel R . This is a children's game. Keep it that way. No need for that language
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm no saint but I have nephews that will repeat at the worst possible times lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im far from even being considered to have a good mouth. But ive been around kids (swim coach/life guard for 5 yrs) enough to filter it pretty well.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And I dealt with 5 up to 17 yr olds. Very diff language was used haha
GroupMe  ----->  Amanda added Elizabeth Kidd Yost to the group.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Welcome Elizabeth! This is a higher version of our mystic chat. We discuss theory and try to handle any drama that might occur in the big/mystic chats
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You are now a mystic elder!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Aw shucks!
Cindy R  ----->  Yay!!!  Hi @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Hi @Cindy R!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May did you really run to waterfall? I would like a video of it!
Darren May  ----->  No I don’t think they needed me. I did run from Samford hall to Dixie Bibb for my first miltank. That would have been some good footage
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would pay for that! Hahaha
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Looking to make y'all proud. Since I'm not getting rare candies it's helping go for that million stardust.
Ian Fraser  ----->  I think I remember that Darren. I met you walking back or something irrc. 
Cindy R  ----->  There are spots open
Cindy R  ----->  Sorry...wrong group
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Now look what you did @Keaton Rhea lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hahahahaha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oops
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Kento would comment on it after I explained it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R @Daniel R am I catching up?
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'll get there in no time
Cindy R  ----->  Looks like you have!!!  @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So close now! Time to start grinding more I guess....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm still 32 something but we did level hucleberry
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Only caught about 400 lavitar 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not bad! No idea how much I caught, but prob not too much. Missed part of beginning coming back from Columbus this morning
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  The very first one was perfect.....by by to getting  million stardust
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dropped everything and ran out to go catch right after I got home haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This is what I've got from today. So sad about my 98
David Busby  ----->  Only spent dust on the 💯
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I spent dust and tons of candies. Those bottom 4 are hatches. Other 2 were wild caught and evo
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby I’ll need you to retroactively check me in to the silph road later. I tried but it says I’m not event staff. I’m just ignoring all the group chats right now since I’m salty about not getting to come. Only caught 16 total larvitars, no shinies
Keaton Rhea  ----->  RIP Darren. I hope you at least got an evo or two in
Darren May  ----->  I got 3. I at least caught one weather boosted that actually turned into my highest cp ttar
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I didnt know how much I was going to b able to play but I should of just did the last 30 mins on your account..  sorry didnt think about it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I quit with sit 1hr left bc I evo a 98 and got iron tail. TLDR, I punted my phone into the bushes
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I evolved 3, 1 shiny and 2 with 15 attack. I wish I had remembered to evolve this guy though. I was distracted trying to get he kids to evolve theirs before it ended and forgot him 😕
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I got 10 shiny. Ofcource all bad IVs 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Best I had
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost I am sorry! Save him incase niantec gets their head out their a.... And makes pokemon have real moves. Exclusive and legacy moves only leads to a toxic environment and they have not figured it out yet
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh I will!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just let us TM it in! All it does is alienate casuals and frustrate hardcore players.  Really 90%  of the moves in this game are usuless on every pokemon
Amanda  ----->  @Daniel R Where’d you catch the hundred
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There was one at down town Opelika and one at arb
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Daniel and cindy got it down town Opelika
Amanda  ----->  Missed the arb by seconds
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So sorry Amanda! :(
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just remember what @Sam Kawell says, IVs don't matter much... But man the salt and sadness
Amanda  ----->  This was my shiny evolve though😁 low level, but I will love him up some.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Love now!
Amanda  ----->  As soon as I get home.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mine not so good, but was high lvl
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  My shiny has terrible stats!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost just remember its shiny and that is all that matters!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is what I keep telling my self
Phil Pearson  ----->  My evolved from yesterday 
Darren May  ----->  *InsertDavidSalt.Gif*
Sam Kawell  ----->  This guy was the first latvitar I clicked on and I didn't have to power him up
Sam Kawell  ----->  But my best shiny wasn't so good
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Amanda sorry just say your chat. Yeah we've been doing downtown Opelika on community days. More stops to be lured. But....niatic specifically gave us that 100. At 1pm exactly it was the first to pop up at the stop we lured first.
Matt Inger  ----->  I only found one shiny down in PCB but I was happy to find my first 100 ttar 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If your using poke genie make sure to double check. I've seen a few errors this morning.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  This seems to be an 89IV. Also can't be a level 37 on a level 36 account and not topped out 
Darren May  ----->  Ready to trade pidgeys with @Keaton Rhea until we become best friends
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh yeah lets re roll all of them for another hundo pidgey
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im kinda more excited about more premier balla at raids over the trading. Better catch rates and possibly more bundles for rares!
Darren May  ----->  I think I’ll be in the market for shinies at least. Maybe re-rolling raid bosses
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes for only 40k dust, I would love to reroll some things. It should b easy to get ppl to trade a rai for a rai etc
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I will have to wait and see bc if  you trade a raid boss IVs 10-15, will it stay that way on re roll. If it can be 0-15 then it wont b worth it at all
Darren May  ----->  I was waiting for you to do the math based on the articuno/moltres trade from the screenshot. Looks like it may be a smaller cp range. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dont think I can. They are not lvl 20 and it would b a lot of guessing haha
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think trading will be short lived. I'm willing to help others that don't have but seems like it will be a steep cost.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean you can almost get 40k dust in 30mins during this water event. I dont see that being too steep. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  But not while I'm at work and when triple ends it's just sad lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah with out triple, it would prob take 1.5hrs of straight grinding
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And we got other things to power up like a flawless kyogre
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  For a minutes I was proud to be over 500k dust.....then ttar day..so long dust..
Amanda  ----->  Flawless, boosted Kyogre...😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im so happy I caught it. I only had 9 balls and got it on second to last one. 
Darren May  ----->  Best friends much more likely to receive stronger Pokémon from trades per IGN. Also takes at least 90 days to become best friends 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well look what I go plused this morning.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So at least 3 months. Gonna take a while
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m probably only going to put dust into one of these right now but I can’t decide which. Which one would you guys do? Defense isn’t that important right?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would personally prob do the lvl 25 one since it's a little better overall. Its only an extra 30 candies and 34k dust to take to lvl 29. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I like IVs even tho they don't matter that much
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That was my thought but it’s tempting to power up the level 29 since it won’t take as many resources 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's still your choice if you want to save the 34k dust and 30 candies
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Cindy's birth day stir fry veggies, check, marinating steak, double check 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Man that looks good!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yum!  Happy Birthday, @Cindy R! You and Leslie share a birthday. 
Cindy R  ----->  Aww..thanks Elizabeth!  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Which one is mine @Daniel R @Cindy R ? Lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Let's see.....that one.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They all look good!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And Tuesday Wednesday lunch and dinner
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Man that looks a week worth of food!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Share? Yes sounds like I need some. Lol jk
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well you know they get left overs
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Good boys/girls
Keaton Rhea  ----->  !
David Busby  ----->  Those doggos about to be eating way better than me 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby they deserve it! Look how cute they are!
David Busby  ----->  But steak 😢 I’ll be a good boy!
David Busby  ----->  Lol
David Busby  ----->  Oh and happy birthday Cindy!
Cindy R  ----->  Thanks😁
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I may not have had steak for dinner, but I get homemade ice cream for dessert 😁
Cindy R  ----->  Hmmm....yummy! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Whose account is this? Haha
Sam Kawell  ----->  I was looking through the main group from last night and a level 26 has no right in the world to use the word "finally" when he is showing off his first shiny Magikarp
Sam Kawell  ----->  *28
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I know. They prob have not even caught 50 of them yet
Sam Kawell  ----->  I know I'm a far shot from Daniel, but I feel like 800 karps should have given me one by now
Darren May  ----->  I had the same reaction when I saw one of the non-mystic pharmacy casuals post something about finally got his perfect kyogre. I was about to go off until I saw the picture and it was a 10/10/10 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I am only at 1190 karp and I think that is stupid lucky to have two
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm in such a denial about shiny carp that I forgot huckleberry go plused one. I had labeled it's IV and everything lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well there is trading @Daniel R ... Huckleberry might not have any shiny once that comes out haha
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I saved some heracross
David Busby  ----->  Oh yea you can have a shiny karp for a decent heracross
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, an update dropped last night and searches are now saved when making or editing battle parties and when placing in gyms
Keaton Rhea  ----->  About time...
David Busby  ----->  I just want a button for defending that would then take me to the gym. I know you can use defender but the amount of times I type defemder is embarrassing 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like my Android text predictions
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Darren May Odds are ~1 in 450 for shiny.  Was just telling Jenny the other day that means for every punk out there that gets a shiny magikarp on their 40th encounter there’s some poor soul that’s waiting until almost 1000 before they get theirs (I know that’s not quite how averages work but it’s close enough to the general idea)
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Sorry that was supposed to be @Sam Kawell 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Sam Kawell 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah those punks are taking Daniel's shiny karps
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt yeah, I found a chart that shows the percent chance of one having a shiny based on the number of encounters and I'm at 80%. @Daniel R is at greater that 99%
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Sheesh. I wish I could check that with some of mine but I don’t know how many I caught before shiny forms were released 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby this isn't quite what you asked for, but it's something
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell just give us boxes already. Let us use custom labels (atk, def, event, etc), quick search thru them and swipe/scroll thru them kinda like battle parties. Its been in main series since day one. No excuse why its not already here
Sam Kawell  ----->  Amen
Sam Kawell  ----->  Who are all these new mystics that just got added?
David Busby  ----->  What the crap
David Busby  ----->  Who added the first one that added all the others
Sam Kawell  ----->  I just looked back and it was Debbie earlier
Sam Kawell  ----->  On Saturday
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Debbie added him on community day. They were at the museum tonight and Amanda showed him how to add people. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think he is Mojo’s friend. 
David Busby  ----->  Ok yea I don’t like that
David Busby  ----->  That’s how mojo and storm end up in mystic 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So we kick them all?
Sam Kawell  ----->  I vote Yes
David Busby  ----->  Yes from me
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Double yes
David Busby  ----->  I’m gonna kick dude that added all the other dudes
Darren May  ----->  F
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Why do we have to be so mean about it?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I've seen Daltons name but haven't actually seen him
Sam Kawell  ----->  Maybe check with Debbie? I don't want to kick him just bc he doesn't know the rules, but I would prefer if someone could vouch for him
Sam Kawell  ----->  But he isn't 30 yet, sooo.....
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I met Dalton on Saturday and the three of them were at the museum. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  ...Tonight for a raid
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby well handled
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Hit gold on first of many Montgomery gyms.
Darren May  ----->  Wait, kyogre is gone tomorrow? Rip my shiny
Sam Kawell  ----->  Thursday
Darren May  ----->  Oh nevermind then I’ll definitely get one in the next 2 days
Sam Kawell  ----->  That's what I said when the event started
David Busby  ----->  Thursday before three I’m assuming tho
David Busby  ----->  Let me know if you see her and her friends putting in some work
Amanda  ----->  I was talking to him about adding to the big group. They’re all definitely Mystic and 2 of them are already level 30. They were super nice group and were excited to learn more about the game...hope we didn’t ruin some of the fun for them😔 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I met the Dalton guy yesterday at a raid. Very new to game but he was nice too. 
Amanda  ----->  He was definitely knew, but was genuinely excited to learn. We were talking about ex raid passes.
Amanda  ----->  *new
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think he said his first community day was larv so lvl 28 is pretty understandable
Darren May  ----->  I’m afraid this is the least excited I’ve ever been for a @Keaton Rhea spreadsheet 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol it's coming. Get ready for a dead heat when its not cloudy or sunny....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It all depends on weather
David Busby  ----->  My 7 level 40 machamps and hariyama are ready for Regis in cloudy 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If its not cloudy or sunny, then champ is still top tier for easy 5 man.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  TLDR: mach is a monster that almost everyone has a bunch of in almost all weather except sunny. Moltres will have the best TDO (and some times DPS) in all weather bc it resists all of regice moves; however it costs rares.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  To bad heracross didn't come into play. I've noticed the game will sub them in over machamp depending on weather
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I forgot hera. I bet he is good in cloudy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I usually dont put regionals kn
Keaton Rhea  ----->  In
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hera is slightly worse than champ in cloudy weather. Around 7 percent worse
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ah yed. He is usable at least. I hate his onr bar move over champ, but he might live a little longer vs EQ regice bc of the resist. But prob not bc both have bad def to begin with
Sam Kawell  ----->  Man, I could see it being hard to get groups to do these raids bc they're lengthy with not much reward
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah its right were 4 man is hard even with ideal weather. 5 man is still pushing it without weather if you have just one low lvl
Sam Kawell  ----->  If they allowed legendaries in gyms even with restrictions (like one per gym), there would be much more incentive to get the Regis
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean a 4 man champ in cloudy might be fun the first time. After that there is no reason to do more for most ppl
Darren May  ----->  I might power up a moltres to the first breakpoint but otherwise I think I’ll roll with what I got. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Unless they release shinies the first time around. That would probly be smart
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Pokegenie still says machamp is my best counter even in sunny weather. I only have Moltres from research so I’m definitely not powering up one of those. 
Darren May  ----->  Probably going to be 2 weeks of regice then shiny groudon or Ray Ray to sell more passes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes that or they put shiny Groudon mixed in a week b4 regive ends bc they realize they are not selling passes
Sam Kawell  ----->  They did it'll be regice until July 19th...
Darren May  ----->  Yeah meant the mix, which is annoying in its own way
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ah, yeah. Like they did for Latias
David Busby  ----->  What’s entei looking like in sunny weather? I took an entei to 30 a while back
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I will have to check, but he was worse than molt and flareon I think
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby a lvl 39.5 entei comes in at 13.1 DPS sunny. Its on only a little better than lvl 29 flareon and lvl 28 molt at 12.8DPS. Lvl 33 entei is 12.8DPS
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I didn’t see you. I had to retreat back to the office to reduce my salt levels. They were reaching @David Busby levels after Parker and kento both got shinies.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I was sprinting back from cary b4 you got there bc advisor called me right when I got to cary. I saw you at the top of the haley concourse
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I figured you would of seen me bc when I run it looks about as graceful as an octopus falling out of a tree
Darren May  ----->  Unfortunately im pretty focused on the screen when I’m in quick catch mode. Of course now my bag is full so I actually have to go through it and do some transfers
Darren May  ----->  Hey buddy old pal
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😕
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Hopefully they will roll it out to lower levels. Didn’t they do that with something else?
Darren May  ----->  Raids originally 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s what I was thinking. 
Darren May  ----->  6225 5006 1156 My trainer code. Need someone to add me as the gifts are piling up. I refuse to be friends with a non-mystic first
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I would if I could. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Let me open thus game and see what's what
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May pls post your number separately
Darren May  ----->  6225 5006 1156
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Must be an update I don't have yet 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No update but I had to close the app and reopen. For it to appear. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Daniel R you might just need to restart the game
Amanda  ----->  2072 2600 3280
Amanda  ----->  🤗🤗🤗🤗
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  6729 5207 3049
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell I think I sent you a gift. Hope it wasn’t trash. I need to clear an egg slot to try for an alolan egg 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  �now I need a poke stop.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Cindy's 5960 7086 9506
Darren May  ----->  Looks like pretty high drop rates for gifts thus far
Sam Kawell  ----->  Thanks @Darren May 
Sam Kawell  ----->  7254 8535 2799
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby just copy and past your number
Sam Kawell  ----->  The number bar goes blank if you have to swap between apps
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Let's be friends in Pokémon GO! My Trainer Code is 9670 1313 6726!
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't think that'll work either...
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  9670 1313 6726
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Sorry wasn’t paying attention to why was actually pasted
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Also @David Busby did you copy that message to KimmieDimmie from the one I posted way back?
David Busby  ----->  No meant to but couldn’t find it 
David Busby  ----->  Wait so is my friend code going to change since I screenshot?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  It looked almost identical to what I remember saying, pretty impressive 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Sam Kawell Gift was 2 max revives, 10 pinap, 5 ultra balls. Not sure how standard that is
Keaton Rhea  ----->  8168 1924 5664
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Make sure to have open egg slots when you open gifts if you want chance at alolan egg
Sam Kawell  ----->  That's around what I got
Sam Kawell  ----->  Keep an eye out for lunatone
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So sending gifts will not cost stardust but I guess there will be a limit?
Darren May  ----->  You can send 1 gift per person per day. I’m getting a gift with just about every spin.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R @Daniel R gonna need your friend codes after your raid!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ok I'll repost
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Is it in mystic chat? I missed it. Ill scroll
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It's in this one
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R @Daniel R I found it. I stupid
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I sent add
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  9496 6678 2269   Yay!
Phil Pearson  ----->  0337 5965 2932
Ian Fraser  ----->  Just sent to everyone who’s posted so far 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh expect David. One sec
Sam Kawell  ----->  So do we want to add the new Zach (when he gets to 30), and Justin and his wife? I heard that @Amanda can vouch for Justin and his wife and I raided with Zach some today and I think he should be added
David Busby  ----->  Zach just got a perfect regice
Sam Kawell  ----->  Nevermind then
Sam Kawell  ----->  He also got a shiny Kyogre on his first Kyogre raid
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Umm guys...? Can we just add if we think it's good? Zach is good. 
David Busby  ----->  I’m good with Zach
Sam Kawell  ----->  That was a joke
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oops
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And by good, I mean he proved him self in person
David Busby  ----->  Although he did get more shiny hos than me
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well he told me he should be 30 in the next couple days
David Busby  ----->  He should be thirty within the next few days at the rate he’s raiding 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No spoofs! Rest is good. If your active then lvl 25 is fine  by me. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess im too accepting
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m with you @Keaton Rhea   I don’t like excluding people. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I guess I don't have a problem with that. 
David Busby  ----->  Are you really active if your below level 30 tho...
David Busby  ----->  Freaking huckleberry is level 36
Cindy R  ----->  He's pretty active 😂😂😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Once again, I guess I am too accepting... But they try
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok.... I think we should expand our bounds. Lower than lvm 30 and friends benefit up now.
Keaton Rhea  ----->   We need to know low lvls and help them
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not saying add all. But low lvls will help us now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They have to be some one that plays eithb you more than once
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think you've swayed me. Especially since there are a bunch of people who are new, but playing actively so their playstyle doesn't reflect their level
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. New folks good! I was rhirs way b4, but I got shame from orhers in NC :/
Ian Fraser  ----->  I think that you’d be surprised at how long 28-30 can take if you’re not marathoning raids. Took Catie forever. Although she definitely qualifies as casual so. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I cant think that way. I do what ever to carry raids.  I will do a tier 2 with a noob. I just want use to be friends now!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not gonna lie, I did a t3 sharpedo with some one yesterday. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mystics can benefit, whike storm can suffer
Keaton Rhea  ----->  While
Cindy R  ----->  I agree! We were all lower levels at one point.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Cool. I'll add them then
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. I want help for lower ones that appeals to all! We need local control
Sam Kawell  ----->  At 8:30 if there are no other objections
Amanda  ----->  Ya’ll already know I agree😁 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby @Phil Pearson @Taylor Pruitt @Darren May @Michelle U @Matt Inger @
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sooner the better! I go sleeps early
David Busby  ----->  I mean y’all know my opinion but if I’m the only one then ok
Keaton Rhea  ----->  David think of the kids!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby  take the hate on me if you want
David Busby  ----->  It is what it is 
David Busby  ----->  These freaking eggs need to hatch 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes, but it should help us. If not then take it out on mebfpr promotion of it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  On me for
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I’m fine with letting people in under 30. Would prefer the rule be that one of this group had to add them, but don’t see how we could enforce that without opening a can of worms about who’s in this group and who isn’t 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Then again it literally won’t affect me at all because I don’t ever see the main mystic group anymore
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ummm. You are the leader! Elder mystic Taylor.... We  need help..'..
Darren May  ----->  I’m fine with adding lower levels if we are sure they are legit (not spoofers or instinct plants). And in defense of the lenient folks like @Keaton Rhea @Sam Kawell and @Amanda, the additions we debated the most have turned out to be fine.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes! Let them help!
Sam Kawell  ----->  I haven't met the KimmiDimmer girl. Has anyone else?
Amanda  ----->  That was the wife we were waiting on at Felton
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh, cool
Sam Kawell  ----->  What about Dalton @Amanda 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dalton is cool guy. No idea on what hr does for playing. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Met oncex I vote for addd
Sam Kawell  ----->  I've just never met him
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Once....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He is a real person. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is all I can add.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  All I know is I’ve never met him 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt I didn’t even know this group existed until Amanda added me. That may be true for others. One way to do it is to make the rule that only an admins in the mystic group can add people. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost That’s the idea 😬 nothing against anyone not in this group, but it serves a specific purpose and everyone knowing about it only turns it into a “when can I be in the majority group” discussion and it all goes out the window. I forgot that we had added all the admins to main mystic though 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dont think this group is intended to b about bragging rights. It's a collection of ppl with a higher understanding of core game mechanics and more importantly, sound moral judgment. We carry a lot of power over mystic chat but I would rather us never use it and stay in the dark.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Plus we get to talk about how to introduce advanced strategy and basic game etiquette
Darren May  ----->  So the best strategy is to alternate giving gifts with a person every day since the friendship level can only be increased once per day?
Darren May  ----->  Wow this will take a lot of effort and management. Just like a real friendship 😂 Also RIP my bag space 
Cindy R  ----->  Darren I was thinking the same thing this morning!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You can increase friendship level by doing raids together too so I thought about keeping my gifts until the end of the day and giving them to people I haven’t done raids with that day. I’m not sure my little brain can keep up with that though. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  That was going to be my scheme
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think we will end up giving tons of gifts. They seem very common. But I do agree on holding off
Darren May  ----->  You have to keep the restrictions in mind too. You can only hold 5 gifts in your bag at a time so it would be hard to give gifts to all your leftover friends at the end of the day
Darren May  ----->  Also I think there are restrictions on how many you can send and how many you can open
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I think you can only open 20. I hit limit yeaterday
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im gonna spam as many as I can today, but I know zach sent over 4 yesterday. Idk what the limit is to send
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm pretty sure you can hold more than 5 in your bag unless they changed it, bc I had up to 11 yesterday once
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Keep in mind you can also trade with some one if you want to lvl up friendship. It doea require you to be close but raids are not required
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its only 100 dust to trade pidgey
Sam Kawell  ----->  You can also work on your trade distance that way
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think this is lvl one sam, but can the lvl change?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hmm, it looks like that is a possibility from the Silph road....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And this bad boy!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry *** girl. I didnt even check gender
Sam Kawell  ----->  That's what I named mine!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nice! Great minds think alike
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mine might b lvl 2 then tho bc it has higher CP and HP. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, that's what the bar looks like
Sam Kawell  ----->  I wish they held the level constant (for people above level 35) and just rerolled the IVs
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Agreed. 
Darren May  ----->  I think they’ve changed the gifts in bag to 5. I’ve been set at 5 all morning 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  My head hurts. So are you/anyone friending everyone in sight or just select? 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Not that wouldn t send everyone a gift but seems like there will be limits
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was going to b somewhat selective... But im not going to tuen anyone down
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Turn
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And I thought about it, and why not? More friends seems like a good thing
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Yesterday picked up about 30 gifts, thus morning maybe 1. I wonder just how abundant they will be
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dmg balls, extra dmg in raids seems like a win.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I forgot about that....its to much but oh yeah.....its Friday. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not everyone needs to get a gift! Just the ones you think you will raid the most with I guess
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I spin a lot of stops for quests. I hope to get a bunch of gifts to help me lvl up friendship with ppl I dont see every day
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May on week days, we can prob trade trash for trash to lvl up
Sam Kawell  ----->  Or like Elizabeth said, only give gifts to those you won't probably raid with
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  The odd thing is I need to gift most in this group. We chat about something everyday but rarely actually raid together. EX  doesn't count lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like that I can look at everyones stats now
Sam Kawell  ----->  I just wish we could favorite particular friends bc it's weird seeing Parker at the top of my list all the time
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can see km walled and poke caught. Wish there was a few more
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We need favorites, search and filters 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like only mystics
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think they should have made that before the released the feature... It's a pretty obvious thing
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That might be too complicated for Niantic 😂
Darren May  ----->  My problem is we know that I’m a closet casual so will I really keep putting forth the effort to up my friend level everyday with all these low level randos, kento’s alts etc?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I likes these gifts tho.. Im just going down the list spamming them to fill up everyones inbox haha
Amanda  ----->  Is anyone else just really attached to their Pokémon and looking at them ...maybe possibly talking to them ...telling them not to worry that they’re not going anywhere????
Amanda  ----->  I have issues.
Amanda  ----->  @Sam Kawell Although, I would be happy for you to have her...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😂@amanda
Amanda  ----->  It’s bad.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, you did get rid of a lot so you must have only kept your very favorites. I’m willing to trade but the only thing I’ve got is a couple of heracross. Hopefully I will catch more when we go to Florida next month. 
Amanda  ----->  Last 3 are not up for trade, the first 5 are though. Wanted ya’ll to have 1st dibs. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Hate that I can’t trade with y’all 😭
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Jenny and I are just going to come home after work every day and sit in the couch and trade with each other 😂 
Amanda  ----->  You can visit soon! Football season will be about the time we get best friend status!
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Is anyone else thinking about duoing legendaries with best friend status?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Would be super nice if Jenny and I could do them on our own
Amanda  ----->  This helps Adam and I even more
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wow. We beat it with 5. Lvl 36, 39, 26, 33 and me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also does not seem to b a limit on how many gifts to send. Ive sent 54 today
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I haven’t even spun a stop yet. 😢 I need to get some gifts to send. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So my brother is just back from Israel, and just sent me his trash he caught
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also in all the trading my brother did with me, the level never increased, even with a level 1 we traded. So I'm willing to try to trade with either Keaton or Amanda if you guys are
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wait, so level is constant but IV and thus CP is rerolled? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  So of the three variables only one gets rerolled? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think lvl can go down @Ian Fraser 
David Busby  ----->  @Amanda I might need one of those heracross. Only stuff I’ve got worth trading that y’all won’t have is excess shinies. So I’ve got a karp, meditite, and wailmer I’d be ok with giving up for the right thing
Amanda  ----->  I need the meditite. 
Amanda  ----->  @Sam Kawell I would just like a colossal magikarp for my Chansey. Don’t you need both mine and @Keaton Rhea ‘s so you have a lvl 1 Blissey too, or do you already have one lvl 1.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ill take what ever you want to give. She needs a better home
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @David Busby I want your shiny wailmer  do you have a corsola?
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Did you ever run the numbers for smackdown ttar vs regice?
David Busby  ----->  Cause it’s partly cloudy 
Amanda  ----->  @David Busby Take the meditite off your trade list please.
David Busby  ----->  I do not but I’m not sure how many shinies I’ll trade for regionals 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes, in partly cloudy its better than lvl 40 champs. I think about 12 DPS
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Amanda deal, I'll don't have one now, but I'll let you know when I do. I have a bunch of extra small ones, but I know you don't want one of those
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But only a bit better. It was like 12 vs 11.8 (I think)
Darren May  ----->  I have corsolas 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I almost think champ will do better in most battles bc of 2bar vs 1 bar tho
Amanda  ----->  Are Alolan eggs temp with gifts?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby  ^ if you are about to short man a raid
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Keep in mind, regice can have quick AND/OR charge fighting moves. Both make it pretty usless unless you max revive
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  For anyone that seems to have all that extra bag space for collecting
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok so I sent 56 gifts today alone. Im already over 20 to open for tomorrow. I sense a problem
Ian Fraser  ----->  No problem. Send more to me. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Hey this may be an obvious question, but can you get more than one gift from a stop in a day? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got home from one stop in one day
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Got tons from***
Darren May  ----->  Yeah you can only have 5 in your bag at a time though
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The 5 in bag is sooooooo awful. All I wanna do is fill your spam box efficiently..  but no they wont let me
Darren May  ----->  My bag space is out of control. I’m going to have to trash max revives and max potions
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May tag pharm skool!
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Michelle U 
Darren May  ----->  The gifts add up quick 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well tag and screen cap! @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  Do you get any candies when you trade?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im ready to b a gym bully!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes 1 low end to 3 max
Darren May  ----->  Of what you trade? Or what you receive?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What you trade I think? Sam told me that so I know its right
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive only done one trade
Darren May  ----->  Hmm. I have a zapdos I caught in DC that I can trade for the distance medal
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im going to Zurich and Stockholm in Aug. I plan to bring back as much as my data plan can
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Massive pruge for my hoarding is gonna b hard
Darren May  ----->  I need a way to search my pokes for their location caught. I have 6 from San Diego I can trade
Cindy R  ----->  I forgot...I may have some pokes from MN, PA, NY, and NJ...gonna have to start looking through them. 
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Was cleaning out my box and realized I forgot about this guy. How would he do against regice? 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Daniel R I'll take him!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Sam Kawell if your still up trade me a pidgie I just didn't want to trash him without offering lol.
Cindy R  ----->  Do you guys collect all level 1 or selective ones?  I have 4 just from this week.  Natu. Spinark, Walimer, and mudkip.  If not will trash...let me know which ones you might want and I will start look in my for those as I clean out my bag.
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby Are you looking for a body slam snorlax? I have a trash iv one
David Busby  ----->  I am but I might be able to steal one from Jin’s alt
David Busby  ----->  Also if anyone has rock throw omastar or shadow claw gengar I’d be intrigued 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Daniel R I'll trade with you on Mondays. I'm currently out of town
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Cindy R I just like the rarer level ones, not super common ones.
Darren May  ----->  I don’t think anyone has rock throw omastar
David Busby  ----->  Pretty sure Jin does. That motherfucker has been hardcore since day one
David Busby  ----->  I do know @Keaton Rhea is holding onto some shadow claw gengar
David Busby  ----->  But we also might get that for a community day
Matt Inger  ----->  I got a couple body slam and one shadow claw but all are bad iv.  The one I need is Unown. I know nobody would trade one but I’m curious if anyone has more than one of them.  I remember one sighting in Auburn that some people got. I really only see them in gyms in big cities.  Anyone have any insight on them other than just being very hard to find?  Also I got a couple extra mr mime that I could part with. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think I have 2 SC gengar. One is at 40
Cindy R  ----->  @Matt Inger both daniel and I need Mr. Mime..I have 1 unown, but now that it's in my dex i would be willing to trade that to you if you need it for your dex for the mime's
Matt Inger  ----->  @Cindy R    Cool, we’ll have to set that up when I get back in town
Cindy R  ----->  Sounds good, I'll start saving my dust 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol cindy saving dust
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry if that was mean @Cindy R ! Just a joke!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Had a few at the lake today
Cindy R  ----->  It wasn't mean...my response didnt go through.  We are at the lake too.  lol


Ian Fraser  ----->  I’ve got a few Pokies from Maine that I can pass around. Think I trashed all my Canada ones. :( 
Amanda  ----->  @Matt Inger Am I getting my true Alolan Pokémon from you??😁😁  I can save my Pokémon I’m getting from your eggs for distance trade with you.
Amanda  ----->  It may not be you, but I’ve gotten 2 from Hawaii 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Looks like Hawaii to me. I may need to take the dog on another late night walk so I can open this one!
Matt Inger  ----->  Yep, just y’all are all getting true Alolan Pokémon! 
David Busby  ----->  My man
David Busby  ----->  I’ve got a Hawaii egg too 😊
David Busby  ----->  And a couple from @Taylor Pruitt and one from @Phil Pearson 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Matt Inger add me and we can swap, I’ll get you one from Houston
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  9670 1313 6726
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Welcome to the group by the way, I’m not very active in here anymore so don’t think I told you yet
Phil Pearson  ----->  Hey @Matt Inger  add me too and I’ll send you Australian gifts
Matt Inger  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt Thanks! Glad to be here!
Phil Pearson  ----->  0337 5965 2932
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t get a Hawaii egg in mine. Please send me another one @Matt Inger 😁
Sam Kawell  ----->  Magikarp really like me
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thanks, @Matt Inger!  I got one!
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Matt Inger No egg 😔 sending you a gift now if you want to try sending me another
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Actually looks like I’ve already sent you one within the time frame so won’t let me send any other right now 
David Busby  ----->  https://discord.gg/ptXX2s
David Busby  ----->  That’s the link to join the bham discord @Ian Fraser if Sam hasn’t already beaten me to it 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Thanks man! Not sure if I’ll ever have the energy to get out in the evening after work, but I need to get back to raiding. 
David Busby  ----->  Where in Birmingham are you? I had to travel to Hoover to find raids
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m near Irondale/Trussville. About 25 minutes east of Railroad Park area 
David Busby  ----->  Oh yea your gonna have to go downtown to raid I’d bet
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea that’s what I thought. Probably can only do that on the weekends too. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Their Trussville channel is pretty dead 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Matt Inger Made the mistake of opening your gift without an open slot, so no egg again, but I did get a metal coat
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Wasn’t thinking when I opened it
Matt Inger  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt  I’ll send more tomorrow, I’m in Maui now so not as many stops, but I should be able to send to all of y’all.  I’m gonna try and send some through my wife/son’s account so be on the lookout for professor inger 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Cool, I appreciate it!
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May is that an Australian remoraid?
Darren May  ----->  Weird. I was messing around with trades with snookems so it probably confused the game
Darren May  ----->  This may shock everyone but I am terrible at keeping up with my friend progress.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Me too, @Darren May! 
Cindy R  ----->  It's a full time job! Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im over loaded with gifts. I cant open them fast enough. Ive got 30 right now...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The 20 a day limit is just too low. I need to open more and just not get items
Cindy R  ----->  Yea, I cant hatch fast enough. Not to mention most eggs have been the stupid meoweth .
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes all 5 of mine were meowth. They are by far the most common.
Darren May  ----->  I’m trying to burn off all my 2ks so I can load up on Hawaiian eggs
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I mistakenly spun a stop yesterday when I had an open spot for an egg 😱 Fortunately, it was just a 2k. 
Darren May  ----->  Not to alarm anyone but I hatched an egg and don’t have any long distance gifts to replace it. *Cough @Phil Pearson @Matt Inger @Taylor Pruitt cough* Your prompt attention is appreciated. 

Your bestest friend, 
Darren
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What really hurts going through to make sure that happens then.......no egg from that person.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. I saved up three of them and only got 1 egg out of the 3
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  At work without any gifts right now @Darren May but as soon as I get one I’ll send it your way
Darren May  ----->  What’s really bad is I’ve swiped stops twice without thinking since I hatched but didn’t receive another egg. The muscle memory and habit forming potential of this game are incredible 
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea ....it is killing me not to hit this guy, but I have to make you proud and save my dust.  LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  86k so low! How can you live on the edge like that
Cindy R  ----->  Bahaha...I have always been the one that uses it as soon as I get it.  There always seems to be something that needs to be topped out. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like my dust reserves for powering up something right away for a new raid boss or a great wild catch. My weakness is rare bc I keep getting good legendary pokes
Cindy R  ----->  I am work in progress...LOL. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  29 rares away... I need to trade star dust for rares with David
Darren May  ----->  Thanks @Taylor Pruitt. Crisis averted 
Matt Inger  ----->  @Darren May  I sent you one 
Matt Inger  ----->  Friend my other acct 1816 0260 2712
Darren May  ----->  Sweet I’ll save that one for after my next 2k hatch. 
Darren May  ----->  Also save as much trash Hawaiian pokes as you can and I’ll be happy to trade you for progress on the pilot medal
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May make sure to make the alolan variants and trade them as well after you hatch!
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Trade trash kyogre?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I forgot about that. I dont think I cleared them out after regice came in
Ian Fraser  ----->  This has probably already been mentioned but I haven’t been keeping up: is there currently a bug with not reviving coins for the day/not seeing it in your journal? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  *recieving 
Ian Fraser  ----->  *receiving .... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nvm I found it. Dang they need to clean up this UI. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Silph had it earlier. Its just too much crap on the screen
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also the randomly moving coins to another tab? That’s nowhere near your journal? Who’s bright idea was that? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Niantec at its finest. Remove gift open limit (receive zero items after the 20th), put gift notifications in its own tab vy its self. Maybe just up friendship one step or even half a step. Remove gift notifications AND egg spawn for raids noticiations that take up 1/4 screen (or make them optional). Fix one but instead of ignoring them all. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Do that and you have a really well received update! Right off the bat. Literally took me 30 mins of gameplay b4 I said all those things
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also defaulting to the gifts tab is  super annoying. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its saves what I was last on only like 25% of the time
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gifts should not be a tab. It needs its own icon above your profile
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like the weather and quests. Not hard
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh and the heart fill up bar is cute and all but put a damn number beside it! I shouldn’t have to click 4 times to see what my actual progress is on friendship. 
Cindy R  ----->  If we have a wishlist going...I just want to be able to search by name or have a few sort options.  Who are your best friends, by level, alphabetically,  ect...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They are your typically modern app programers with little to no real programming exp. Optimization is thrown out the window for pretty minimalist looks that do not function
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes cindy. I want that tons
Cindy R  ----->  I would even like to see the last time a gift was either sent or received.
Ian Fraser  ----->  ...but it’s not minimalist imo. You’ve got the random last caught for friends and we basically split the journal in two, 4 clicks away. I wouldn’t call that minimalist. I would call having a weather like icon that opens up friends with some basic filter minimalist. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, favorites. I dont wanna see parker on my list
Ian Fraser  ----->  Tho the heart choice I guess is minimalist. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Lol amen
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It started minimalist, and still has those elements. Modern programming version of minimalist ends up this way ass you add features. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They replace almost all numbers outside of dmg (doesnt tell you anything) and CP with graphics. Its text book minimalist. Also, a great example of why it doesnt work for mlst games
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pokemon is built on numbers. Its not gonna work well with random bars and pics
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Searching for friends and sorting options would be amazing!  I would rather see a list of actions I’ve completed with friends than what they are catching. 
Cindy R  ----->  Aww...huckleberry just did a trade! He gave someone a heracross for a farfetched 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Go huckleberry!
Matt Inger  ----->  Are y’all having trouble with stops as well?   I keep having to walk an extra ways to let me spin it.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. I was having hard time earlier. My distance was fine (avatar standing under gym) but I had to restart to spin gym/feed berry
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But it might just be my bad signal
Matt Inger  ----->  I had that happen a couple times, but my main issue is having to get closer to the stop than normal to let me spin it.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Maybe gps shielding from other bindings?
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Matt Inger are you still in Hawaii?  
Matt Inger  ----->  Yeah, I’m here til Saturday 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Then it's probly because you're further south than auburn. Niantic doesn't account for the fact that the Earth is round and because of this (I don't know the exact reason why), the actual radius of your circle increase the further north you go and decreases the further south you go. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  My brother spent a semester in London and was able to take advantage of this, but you get the short end of the stick
Matt Inger  ----->  Ah, that must be it.  I’m getting used to it now anyways 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well then getting back to Auburn will have at least one positive!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I wonder if that will effect me when I go to South Florida. I don’t remember it being an issue last year. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Probably not too much. Miami is just about halfway as south as Hawaii is from auburn
Sam Kawell  ----->  Where in South Florida are you going?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Fort Lauderdale area 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, the effect should be half as strong. Keep an eye out for it, though
Darren May  ----->  Just throwing out that the antipode of auburn is yallingup Australia. Aka the farthest city in the world from auburn 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If anybody wants to send me a long distance gift I’d appreciate it. I have a few open spots @Taylor Pruitt @Matt Inger @Phil Pearson 😬
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thanks @Taylor Pruitt sadly, no egg 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I tried 😔
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Looks like another ex raid we won't be making because of the middle of the day timing.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Also @Amanda pretty sure Katie p is valor 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R and @Cindy R did you both get felton?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Not sure about Cindy and huckleberry I'll check when I get off work though
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok. I am not for sure going yet. but if I do, both me and emily got Felton. We could do a second round for you if you want. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This assumes we both make it haha
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea if Cindy and huckleberry both didn't get one, I'll need help as well
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok that should work!
Darren May  ----->  Um body slam snorlax is the research reward for July 
David Busby  ----->  Wait fr??
Darren May  ----->  Just got the notification when I started up the app
David Busby  ----->   Yea I’m gonna need a 93+ one of those
David Busby  ----->  And I guess I need to start walking a snorlax
Sam Kawell  ----->  Why do you think no legendary?
Phil Pearson  ----->  They got lazy
David Busby  ----->  Probably wanna sell raid passes for raikou again
Darren May  ----->  I need raikou (or rayquaza or groudon) to awaken me from this regice/snorlax induced casual stupor
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda @David Busby can I add mystic karp/starlyte glimmer to mystic group? She does lots of call outs that we might wanna keep blue
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive met her and added her to big group. She knows @Darren May  as well
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So no objection of I add her and explain to post mystic chat first?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh you guys raiding. Sorry ill wait
David Busby  ----->  I’ll leave that to Amanda but I don’t see any reason not to if we’re not being super selective. She’s decently active
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ill add tomorrow unless amanda objects. 
Amanda  ----->  Never would I ever.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Hey, I remember that game. Lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Maybe it was never have I ever. Hard to remember it always involved drinking.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Funny, I always played that game in church groups and it never involved drinking. 😂
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I’m with Daniel on this one 😬
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We had fun playing it but these days I would definitely enjoy it more after drinking. 
Amanda  ----->  @David Busby Did you get it?
David Busby  ----->  Yea tried to get for joe too but right when we decided it was a rip he popped an incense caught something then you said where it was
Amanda  ----->  I think it was the same one Taylor caught, but weather changed at 11
David Busby  ----->  That apt complex he must live in has some dank spawns
David Busby  ----->  I remember running into their backyard twice in one day for beldum
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Do any of you know how to get the qr code for a group?  We added some guy at the museum and he had some weird setting on his phone and cant see it. He said he needs the code
Amanda  ----->  Go to settings and click on share group. It gives the option to share we code.
Amanda  ----->  *qr
Amanda  ----->  But not from this group😁
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  When I go to that in big group, it won’t let me click on it. Can only admins do it in that group?
Amanda  ----->  That’s how the group got taken over before I think was a qr code...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That's sounds questionable.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The QR code or a link was posted on the facebook page I think. That is how they got into group @Amanda 
Amanda  ----->  @Keaton Rhea You’ll talk to holy shif while you’re at 1865 if he’s still there?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ask what? He is not here yet
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He didnt show
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ohh I met him at a raid at Davis a few days ago I think
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda what did you want to know? He was the guy I short maned that regi with
Amanda  ----->  He was asking about Mystic group in big chat
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh ok. Well he was like lvl 26 then
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Did you want me to add him? @Amanda  He was nice but very low lvl and not much knowledge. He seems very gym lite, but he does seem to play at museum 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also...kento needs to know not to golden my beldum
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Caught at my church 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Devil lettuce!
Sam Kawell  ----->  We can now hold 10 gifts!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Woohoo!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  About damn time
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It took 2 weeks to get the last 30 candies to finish him off. I think this game is holding out on me.
David Busby  ----->  Honestly am I the only one surprised at how much dust you have lol
David Busby  ----->  I had 124k and needed 130k to bring my 98 Groudon to breakpoint for a jolteon solo I tried. It might not have been enough but I’d have done it if I had that extra 6k
Cindy R  ----->  Anyone want this little guy..level 1
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Smart A@@ lol. I was trying for that all pro million stardust the heavy hitters always have. But then Ttar day ripped that apart.
Darren May  ----->  Ok they have to increase the gift opening limit too. I hit my limit and have 15 unopened gifts
David Busby  ----->  Roughly 25 at the end of every night 
Cindy R  ----->  Same here... 😥
Darren May  ----->  I hit the limit for the first time last night so I guess most of my “friends” were slacking in their gift giving. 🤨
Darren May  ----->  I guess I would settle for them fixing the friend progress tracker 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  There are some people who send me another gift as soon as I open one from them and I’m like stop dammit!  I can’t handle all these gifts
Cindy R  ----->  I may he guilty!  Bahaha
Matt Inger  ----->  Y’all have too many friends 😁
Cindy R  ----->  Matt I dont know if we are?!
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I’ve only been getting about 5 gifts per day so I’m trying to cycle through, if you’re not getting many from me it’s not just you!
Matt Inger  ----->  I think so but if not 0393 2693 3055
Matt Inger  ----->  I only got one or two friends who I’m not sure who they are
Matt Inger  ----->  I’ve even dabbled with the enemy a little
Cindy R  ----->  Nope, but fixed that..lol
Matt Inger  ----->  Y’all know who this is?   An alt?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Mine and Cindy's alt
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If we don’t want random people adding other random people to the group, somebody’s gonna have to say something. 
David Busby  ----->  Oh and I was the bad guy last time...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Wait I just realized @Matt Inger didn't know huckleberry lol. Apparently we do not raid together lol.
David Busby  ----->  He’s a morning raider 
David Busby  ----->  Also who the hell is mindy Taylor
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Not sure
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No idea 
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Is that the girl you added
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No. It’s not. 
Cindy R  ----->  Just went and looked at her pic, didnt recognize her.
Matt Inger  ----->  @Daniel R Ha! I thought it was y’all but wanted to be sure.  
David Busby  ----->  Well I can make where only admins can add
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh I’ve been seeing her in gyms lately. 
David Busby  ----->  Who the hell added her and when
David Busby  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt Did we leave her in from og purge?
Darren May  ----->  She has been in the group a long time 
Darren May  ----->  ^yes
David Busby  ----->  That is literally the first time I’ve ever seen that name
Darren May  ----->  She has been in the group for as long as I can remember but this is the first time I remember her doing anything. Also didn’t know her trainer name until now 
David Busby  ----->  No way she’s ever posted since I’ve been in mystic. Only person I still don’t know is Carson loyal
David Busby  ----->  That posts ever that is
Darren May  ----->  Only reason I “know” her is that her picture stands out in the group 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was going to say that I don’t know if it’s necessary to make it so only admins can add, there just needs to be communication, but someone who is not active in the group might not see a general announcement. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I’ve met Mindy before. Few and far between but I recognize her. Never been a fan of people who aren’t active just adding other people at will though 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  My logic is that if they’re not already added by one of us they probably aren’t active enough to be in the group. Problem is not everyone follows that logic 
David Busby  ----->  I’m with Taylor on this. That was why this group was created
David Busby  ----->  But I’m not touching anything to do with ladymerkitty. Sabi and others already made that awkward enough
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was in the mystic group way before I was in the big group. 
David Busby  ----->  Yea but that was before we could add over 200
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  True. And I didn’t know anybody. I just connected with Taylor through the Facebook group. I think that’s why it’s weird to me that it is so exclusive
Darren May  ----->  I think it is less problematic if only the admins can add that way we can be proactive instead of reactive. It’s not like it is hard to find one of us if you’re actively playing
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Agreed
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Personally I’m not even worried about it being “exclusive” or not, it’s just that we’ve already gone through cycles where groups have gotten way overpopulated and half the people in them don’t interact with anyone and don’t show up to raids and don’t contribute anything (even friendly conversation) and it just gets messy
Darren May  ----->  I would also like to point out we are only this cautious now because some dumb bama fans infiltrated the big group to destroy it. Sorry @Amanda 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Cindy said ladymerkittys post annoy her more than kento's and that's just sad.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I just want the Mystic group to have a purpose, and in my mind that’s collaborating and meeting for raids and helping mystics improve their game, not really to create a big group of people who are mystic who never play and don’t get anything from the group or contribute anything
Darren May  ----->  Yeah @David Busby, what’s the deal with lady merkitty? I guess I don’t scroll up enough 
David Busby  ----->  I don’t want this to be storm but I’d prefer it to be slightly more selective than valor 
David Busby  ----->  So when I was auburn pogo Uber sabi told her in big group I’d take her anywhere she needed to go. She took this literally and proceeded to dm about giving her rides while at the same time saying how awkward this made her feel. I kept trying to politely refuse but it kept happening so now I just ignore.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  The thing with lady Merkitty is that we already know she doesn’t have transportation and is too old to walk anywhere
David Busby  ----->  I honestly don’t know how she has items 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  And she doesn’t understand the game so she’s not going to contribute like Sam or Keaton do. There’s literally nothing for her to get from mystic group other than FOMO
Cindy R  ----->  Oh David!!!  Thank you for that laugh 😂😂😂😂😂
David Busby  ----->  I’m glad someone can laugh about it lol. Still salty towards sabi for ruining a perfectly good nickname 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  She’s not actually that old but she has some health issues that keep her from walking. I talked to her at community day. She’s a sweet lady but a little bit odd. VERY talkative. 
Cindy R  ----->  Kudos to sabi for being original.  We have thought about getting mystic car decals and tagging a few certain storm cars with them, but would never be that creative!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I felt so bad for @David Busby when I saw them posting that stuff. 
Cindy R  ----->  That is unfortunate but soooo funny. 
David Busby  ----->  Oh I’m still on for deoredx making huge valor decals for jazzys car
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  #auburnpogouberbutnotreallyforeveryoneitsjustanickname.
David Busby  ----->  So who wants to post about casuals adding. I would but @Taylor Pruitt is just so much more eloquent than I am
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  How kind of you to volunteer me
David Busby  ----->  Your still my true leader
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Been thinking about randomly posting a Valor/instinct trainer code in big group and telling everyone to add me
David Busby  ----->  Oh please get the casuals to add lolinstinct
David Busby  ----->  Why me
Ian Fraser  ----->  ...what’s the difference between and adult board game meeting and a board game meeting? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Do I want to know? 
David Busby  ----->  Not with ladymerkitty
David Busby  ----->  About wanting to know
Ian Fraser  ----->  Damn right. Also did we change bug group so only admins can add? Why couldn’t she add mindy herself? 
David Busby  ----->  I’m not explaining how she can add more randos to mystic
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay so that’s what I thought. She just didn’t realize she could add lol. Was just confused why she was asking you for a sec 
David Busby  ----->  Someone get this lady a turtle
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  When she first dmd you was your name still dolphin pogo uber?
David Busby  ----->  No my name would be David Busby
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Yeah I’m confused about the name thing 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Weird
Amanda  ----->  Just read up...I want inclusively exclusive. We need to group clean up every once in a while . If they haven’t posted in a while we kick them. Just like when we first started this. I just hate taking away the opportunity to love/hate the game the way we do just because they started late, and we make them feel unwanted. I am all for an only admin add. Like Darren said if they can’t find one of us raiding, or be pointed to one of us, they don’t need in. 
Amanda  ----->  People like Dalton want to learn and are excited. He may have understood when we kicked him, however it still gives the wrong vibe to a good bit of people. I don’t want it to feel like a cool kids club. It’s impossible anyway really since we all met playing Pokémon 😁😁
Ian Fraser  ----->  I missed out on this. Who was Dalton? 
David Busby  ----->  Debbie added him on community day and it went unnoticed because community day then he added two people to big group and mystic
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have to go help my little man go back to sleep, but I agree with Amanda. 
David Busby  ----->  So I asked why he added them( he didn’t know it was a problem) and I kicked them since no one in here chimed up for them then I kicked him and said hit me up when your 30. He seemed to be cool with it and all three are back in mystic now. I dmed those that got kicked and explained why and they seemed ok with the situation 
Amanda  ----->  Because sometimes I have things to do and they were kicked by the time I read the chat.
David Busby  ----->  You were asleep by like 9
Amanda  ----->  Yes....
Amanda  ----->  Sometimes.
David Busby  ----->  I thought you’d be up 🤷‍♂️
Amanda  ----->  I would have said it then. I showed you the big message I had typed about it the next day, but never sent.🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  David barely gave anyone time to speak up for them. I thought he might back off when I told him that you talked to Dalton about adding them. It was just a misunderstanding bc Amanda thought he was talking about big group not realizing Debbie had added him to Mystic. 
David Busby  ----->  So here’s the thing. Yes I kicked them quickly. I kicked them quickly because we had previously decided on a rule of 30+ and that people in here had noticed them. I noticed none of the names being added and two names were added instantly after being added to big group
Amanda  ----->  But 2 were 30
David Busby  ----->  That no one but you knew
Amanda  ----->  I understand being cautious. I understand why they were kicked. 
David Busby  ----->  I’m just not understanding where I went wrong with this
Amanda  ----->  It was just a time like tonight where I wasn’t near my phone. No biggie. It’s fixed. I feel like a butthole right now because I want to lick Lady Merkitty because the only thing she is active in is the chat...
Amanda  ----->  You didn’t. 
Amanda  ----->  NOT LICK!!!!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Lol was just about to say something 
Amanda  ----->  I repeat. NOT LICK! kick I meant kick.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I should have said something in the main group yesterday but today it's friday and don't care as much. If anyone says there coming to the raid we always wait and or try to make sure everyones there. So when the group at the museum said go in knowing at least one wasn't there it bothered me. And these were lower levels that needed others. Just felt like venting.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I am right there with you. Storm does it all the time. And they do ot to each other
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I understand needing to get it done because people have places to be and can’t wait 15 more minutes for people to show up. But in those cases you need to tell the people coming that you’re starting without them so they don’t walk up as you’re leaving or find out after they came all the way there they got excluded 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Also I was wondering how long Amanda’s typo would remain the latest message in this group, kept seeing it every time I went to my groups list 😂 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That will make her think twice about kicking.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Amanda doesnt kick tho! She licks her haha
Cindy R  ----->  https://goo.gl/images/GVW8av
Cindy R  ----->  Right in the sweet spot....bahaha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  How did you get video evidence of Amanda in action?
Cindy R  ----->  It was tough!  Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Expert camera skillz from cindy
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Phil Pearson Just warning you you’re about to get like 5 friend requests from Pharmacy people 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Everyone wants to be friends with Phil!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Ian Fraser I hope y’all didn’t get wet out a5 the museum. The sky opened up as soon as I got home!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nah we left just before it started raining. Had a nice loud thunder blast that let us know we should leave haha 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Thanks @Matt Inger !
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I’ve hatched three grimer in the last day or two now, but only one is a wonder and that one is 82% 😔
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Keaton Rhea @Amanda @Phil Pearson let me know when y’all open my gift. Y’all are the only three I haven’t sent gifts to today and I happen to have three gifts left
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Also just realized it’s morning for Phil 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im at my gift open limit sadly. I became friends with all of jins accounts so ive got tons to open but I am always at limit :/
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Should be putting priority on those long distance ones though 👍🏼
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I am. But I pretty much only run infinity incubator so its more about friendship right now. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I am very sad that the new boxes do not have raid passes. Ive saved tons of coins and all I want are raid passes. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The friendship bonus is going to really help me bc I do most of my raids in the morning with jin. Campus is dead in the summer
Amanda  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt Gift opened
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't know if anyone has noticed that I have been somewhat lax with my gifting recently, but I'll get back in the swing of things this week. 
Cindy R  ----->  We spent the day at the lake today so have no gifts to send...tomorrow may be a repeat but will get some out on monday for sure!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Speak for yourself I just sent 10
Cindy R  ----->  😋
Matt Inger  ----->  So what have y’all found to be the best Regice lineups?  Fire vs Fighting types?   I did a raid with a bunch of level 40s and they used all Hariyamas.  I guess cause they last longer than the rest.  I’ve seen the spreadsheets that @Keaton Rhea posted but was still wondering what y’all were using.  I’ve just been using one fire party and one fighting party.  My fire types just seem to get run through pretty quick.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I will use all fire like moltres, blast burn char and flareon suicide squad if its sunny. Otherwise it's all high lvl machamp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  In partly cloudy, ttar with smack down and stone edge is slightly better. But it needs to b near lvl 40 to out perform a lvl 40 champ
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And it cant take the fighting moves
Matt Inger  ----->  @Keaton Rhea    Thanks for the info!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, if you want a cheap but good team in the sun, a flareon at lvl 30 with overheat is better than a lvl 40 machamp
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m in Virginia so any gifts you get from me this week will be long distance. 
Michelle U  ----->   Been MIA all summer but if you guys want gifts from Tampa add me ☺
Matt Inger  ----->  @Michelle U   I’m going to send you one of my last Hawaii gifts.  I hope you get an egg!
Michelle U  ----->  Aw thank you! 😊
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I had to ask since he posted in both groups
Darren May  ----->  I was out of town all weekend so I feel like I’m out of the loop. It’s currently double xp for catches, hatches and raids?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t think it starts until 3. 
Darren May  ----->  Hmm. Going to try a lucky egg to get in at least 1 raid and a few friendship level increases. Seems like pretty easy xp
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yep. I got 130k the other night with friendship level increases and mass evolve. If I were in town this week. would definitely try to hit some raids. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It maybe time to play huckleberrys alt for a few days. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, I am pretty sure Penelope stop at museum is hatch 5 for chansey
Darren May  ----->  Any thoughts or preference on the go plus vs the gotcha? I’m thinking about getting one
David Busby  ----->  I like my plus but zach swears by the gotcha. I’d ask him and Pete why they like the gotcha then get back with one of us why we like the plus
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The gotcha auto catches right? Like no clicking
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I would have gotten a gotcha instead but I didn’t know anyone who had one at the time so I went with the go plus. I liked that it has auto catch. 
David Busby  ----->  That’s why I don’t like the gotcha tho. I just don’t wanna have to constantly toggle the autocatch
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have go plus. It works for what I wanted. Something for driving.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And gym take downs. Drive up start battle. Click those red balls away
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R @Cindy R do you guys and huckleberry need us to do raid at felton this week?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  EX raid
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Keaton Rhea we're not going to worry about. Maybe just email niantic and try for a free pass. Thanks for the offer though.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its really no prob. Sam, emily and I all got passes and we can log in on wave two. We will a delete your accounts right after
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Standing there and mashing the screen and talking vs standing there and hust talking is not a big deal
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Plus we can get that hundo for you guys!
Darren May  ----->  Thought I might have to delete some ultra balls but then I remembered community day is this Sunday and I can quick catch everything 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Wow. I thought pushing 300 was a lot
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I refuse to like his shiny post lol
David Busby  ----->  Oh yea I already didn’t like Parker then he went on a streak of hundos and shinies and he’s dead to me
David Busby  ----->  Unless he gets me a torkoal...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Lol if he gets you a torkoal you can refer to him as the undead.
David Busby  ----->  Speaking of people I don’t like Adrianna seems to have quit and kentoo seems bearable now so are we free of everyone except Parker?
Darren May  ----->  You work it out with merkitty?
David Busby  ----->  Nah I’m just going with the ignore that ever happened strategy. Just like a doduo sticking its heads in the sand
David Busby  ----->  Thanks for asking tho
Darren May  ----->  Yeah I guess it’s just Parker then
David Busby  ----->  Like I want to be salty but that timing was just impeccable 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm sure new school year will bring in new attitudes. They just haven't been discovered yet lol 
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea If you figure out how to do this friendship glitch that is being reported on the silph road, let me know. I’m ready to trade
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have not checked it this morning yet. But ill look later
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh wow. That is a major exploit
Ian Fraser  ----->  It sounds like the simply accidentally turned off the “once per day” setting? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/8vo1zs/friendship_increased_from_great_beyond_ultra_from/?st=JJ5QS745&sh=da1f1451
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay actually reading comments that say it’s not affecting everyone. Lol Niantic and spaghetti code. Name a more iconic duo. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Maybe? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sounds too complicated for me. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well that’s only because apparently they did patch whatever was actually causing the bug they just didn’t patch a edge case where you could force the bug due to their poor timekeeping. 
Darren May  ----->  I’ll be device b in this scenario 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I think it would be more clear in proper English 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Just now getting to see any of this, work is busy!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May its about time we synched. How does it feel to be king?
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Very nice. I think you are at the top of my list too if I could ever scroll past all my unopened gifts
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I scrolled past about 50 un opened.... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If you haven’t gotten an egg from me this week let me know and I will send you another gift tomorrow. 
Amanda  ----->  @Keaton Rhea What time are ya’ll doing Felton today. I’m going to do it for Jose.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I am going to try to b there 10 or 15 before hatch so any time. I am doing one of jin's too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost  race to 40? Im only a little bit behind
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well second 40 that is
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ive got a little not of a head start  😉
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not that much!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is like 2 mass evos
Sam Kawell  ----->  Guys, we'll need evening updates from you two
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought I had a major setback when I washed my go plus but it still appears to be working 😂
Amanda  ----->  I’ve washed Adam’s at least 4 times.
Amanda  ----->  Still kicking🤷🏻‍♀️
Sam Kawell  ----->  So bc the two year anniversary of Pogo is tomorrow, I made a pretty graph of my xp progress since I started playing the game. I was pretty casual until 10 mil and then I don't know what happened.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not gonna lie, but if you take amlinear fit and compensated for the exp inc from various things like raids. I bet you kept it solid
Sam Kawell  ----->  Really? It looks like two pretty distinct sections to me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. But when was raids introduced vs your lvl?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It looks clear linear to 35. Nonlinear from on
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think raids were introduced around 35
Sam Kawell  ----->  Cause it was mid July last year
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not here to argue tho. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry
Darren May  ----->  Speaking of arguing 
Ian Fraser  ----->  lol the shameless repost
Darren May  ----->  Dang
Ian Fraser  ----->  Or we literally happened to be browsing reddit at the exact same time 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I saw thay hours ago...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That
Darren May  ----->  I saw it on reddit a few minutes ago and was waiting for the convo to die down. Have big group muted like always
Darren May  ----->  😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea well that’s why we don’t rely on you for shitposts @Keaton Rhea 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea I figured that was why you posted it in here literally minutes later 
Darren May  ----->  I think it was funny enough for 2 posts. Welp back to Reddit 
David Busby  ----->  Just figured out what @Darren May does at work
Darren May  ----->  I usually save Reddit for at night when I’m home. It’s Twitter during the day
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So this might be you at work then
Darren May  ----->  Actually it is pretty busy bc we had someone leave at the end of June so we are having to share her work plus I’m doing the HR stuff for the first time of hiring a new employee. At least it is hot and the legendary raid is terrible so I’m not missing much in pogo right now
Darren May  ----->  Left work early walk across campus to get 2 dratini quests to then solo the T3 hatching at Davis. Davis hatches jolteon. Rip. 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You can always ask for a pleb to help!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or you could of. Im sure you are not still there
David Busby  ----->  @Darren May You know there are four of the quests in auburn right
Darren May  ----->  Yeah, it is just hard for a casual like me to get a raid in
Amanda  ----->  Is that one catcha a dragon old??
Darren May  ----->  Very old
Amanda  ----->  @Sam Kawell Where is your trainer? He’s MIA
Sam Kawell  ----->  He's embarrassed by his appearance for some reason
Amanda  ----->  He must have bought the new Pika gear😳
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Update?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea ...you are so close..lol.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think I caught up!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess I will b more on the casual side. I plan to do 10-12 raids (dpending on how normal free passes count) on two diff accounts. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I saw that they are T4 difficulty so I am gessing small groups will be easy?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You’ll be doing more than me. Stuck in the car all day 😢 
Darren May  ----->  Sounds like you get 6 passes if you saved yesterday’s
Darren May  ----->  I’m wondering if I can do it with my ragtag group of 5 so that I don’t have to coordinate with the masses
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Are you only doing a total of 6?
Darren May  ----->  I would/could do more but my crew can only do 6. If there was a group and close gyms after the 6 I would drag them with me for more
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can do 6 with you darren on emily's
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or mine if you don't think we can beat it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If I find another good grpup after I do those 10 or so, do you want me to do some for you @Elizabeth Kidd Yost ?
Darren May  ----->  That should work but I don’t want you to miss out on raids or another group.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean, I am only going to do a total of 6 on mine. Outside of that, im flexible
Darren May  ----->  Cool. I guess I will plan on being at tractor wing around 12:45. Going radio silent now bc the wife is putting me to work before I can go 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So Ingress is getting a TV show... https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/ingress-the-animation-netflix-ingress-prime-1202867371/
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That seems kinda odd to make movie out of but maybe it works out?
Matt Inger  ----->  Somehow the game knew today was my birthday 🎂😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Very nice! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Matt Inger did you also have a 100% catch rate?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Didn’t hit lvl40 tho. :P
Matt Inger  ----->  @Keaton Rhea yeah I did 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Congrats!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  To both you guys
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I went 12/12 catching on free passes but no shiny
Matt Inger  ----->  Nice, except for the no shiny.  Maybe it’s that 70k Pokémon caught holding you back 
David Busby  ----->  4 shinies and dikfingers got a shiny too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. That is definitely what is holding me back
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Guess I need to catch 80k now
Ian Fraser  ----->  ...I’m currently 200 items over bag space 
Ian Fraser  ----->  You didn’t get a shiny on either account? Dang that sucks. :( 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah its rough. I was about 150. Just deleted all my potions except max. Then deleted 50 max, 50 normal revives and then bought 50 bag space. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No I didnt. No shiny for me. It was a 5% rate based on silph. So not the end of the world. I did get 3 art 90%+. Just not on my account haha
Ian Fraser  ----->  5% should be 1/20 right? lol well at least you can rest easy knowing Articuno is moderately worthless now that we have Ray/Latios. At least I think that’s the case, but you would probably know better than me. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Art is still best ice type.... For now. Mamosiwne (Gen4) will poop all over it tho. Reshiam (Gen5) will poop on both of them. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dragons are best vs dragon for now bc of how bad art js
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Is
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The issue is gen 5 has two cover dragon ledgends; however, dual typing makes one resists dragon and ice. The other resists just ice. 
Matt Inger  ----->  My lapras will run through a dragon in no time   I’ll have to test the dragon vs dragon thing but the ice seems to work well.  I’m def glad to have a few xtra articunos 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Art > Lapras by a wide margin for attacking iirc. Ray > Latios > Dragonite against Dragons by a wide margin tho. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I remember Lapras being a good gym defender when Dragonite was king of the game
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I love me some dragons vs a dragon, they just have less survivability than Lapras or Articuno
Sam Kawell  ----->  But I'm a DPS man not a tankiness man
Keaton Rhea  ----->  DPS > TDO. Well for us here
Darren May  ----->  Wait, latios is better than dragonite?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Uhhh..I thought it was marginally better on attack cause 3bar charge move but Dragonite had better all around stats?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Keaton or Sam will have to weigh in tho, cause they're the experts here.
Sam Kawell  ----->  It's not as good DPS, but some people prefer it because it charges faster. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  From a pure DPS standpoint it's Salamance < Rayquaza < Dragonite with Latios taking up the rear pretty significantly.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Sorry: Salamance > Rayquaza > Dragonite > Latios
Ian Fraser  ----->  Salamence only has the one 1bar charge move right?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, so it's only the best if it gets one off
Darren May  ----->  PSA: Research tasks that give shiny sunglasses squirtle are consistent for all players - https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/8wzb47/psa_research_tasks_that_give_shiny_sunglasses/?st=JJCT8FQQ&sh=c0b9673f
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Your time to shine
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Grace united methodist. Moes bbq. Gargolye theatre statue (5 guys). City marker behind cheeseburger cheeseburger. Teage residence hall. Walker pharm building marker. Miller hall. Duck samford sign. Museum  fountain.
Sam Kawell  ----->  So the last Squirtle I clicked on was shiny, but I caught it around 10 seconds two late and it's now normal..... Booooo
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I read about that happening, but I never thought it would happen to me...
Ian Fraser  ----->  I liked just so I could unlike 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I appreciate that.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dislike
Darren May  ----->  Dang dude. I got one at 3:59 too. I used the quick catch glitch and got it with about 10 seconds to spare
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, as I threw the normal throw I realised my only hope was if I had done the quick catch
David Busby  ----->  Well it happened
David Busby  ----->  Just got the dm from Taylor p to be added to mystic
David Busby  ----->  Opinions?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I've seen his name in chats but not sure how many times I've seen him. Is he mostly on campus? Dies he take down gyms?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Also how did everyone do? I'm exhausted. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Skinny guy with famous quote today? Never wears a shirt
David Busby  ----->  He’s way more active than others we’ve allowed to be added but he can also be ridiculously crude. He was the dude that got kicked from old group after Georgia game
David Busby  ----->  Famously said stay in your slave ball bitch
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dont know if I was even in group then or maybe I didnt pay attention. He can be funny but def not kid friendly. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I say give him a shot
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh his quote today was 'i am going to check grinder to chatch me a real man and a shiny squirttle'
Ian Fraser  ----->  Just tell him that Mystic is absolutely a PG....PG-13ish place.
Ian Fraser  ----->  I remember the slave ball comment lol 
Matt Inger  ----->  I was able to get a handful of shinies from the quests in a short amount of time thanks to everyone calling them out.  My kid’s preschool Grace delivered this guy to me
Darren May  ----->  Anyone know SparklyBlackSun? I got a friend request from them and have never heard the name
David Busby  ----->  Casual
David Busby  ----->  Got added like within the last two days
Darren May  ----->  Weird. I don’t think I posted my code in big group. Maybe I accidentally put it on the website. RIP 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I was thinking the same think....who is babyhater?
David Busby  ----->  Did y’all put friend code on website?
Darren May  ----->  I don’t see mine in the list but I wonder if it doesn’t show up since it’s my account
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I didn't 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I see your code on the website Darren. 
Darren May  ----->  Oh welp. Now I’m offended only one rando added me
David Busby  ----->  And that’s why I don’t give out my code
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think you can delete it. The extra XP for advancing a friendship is nice for those of us who aren’t 40. The bad thing for me is I’m too nice and won’t ever delete anyone. 
Darren May  ----->  The gift caps just make it really annoying to manage every day
Phil Pearson  ----->  I did it!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Congrats Phil!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s pretty impressive that you got 2 million xp in like 4 days!
Phil Pearson  ----->  Yep.. I did 22 articuno raids
David Busby  ----->  Those in the Amanda crew got 1.2 million yesterday
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Bla Bla Bla. I don’t want to hear about it. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You’re not as far ahead of me as I thought you would be. My playing this week will be mostly catching with the go plus and dropping in the occasional gym 🙁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Still pretty good for no articuno raids!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Adding Erin. Seems active enough and just hit 30. 
Darren May  ----->  Is there a trade market for these?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Not sure but there's a trash can for all but 2.
Sam Kawell  ----->  There's probly not a market now, but it'll probly be worth something in a year or so.
Darren May  ----->  Hey weren’t we going to do something do only admins could add people? And when I say “we” I mean someone who speaks gort 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I thought when that discussed the idea was that it would create a pretty high barrier for putting someone in, and so long as we have GORT it’s not like anyone who gets put in can do anything malicious anyway. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  *that was 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes we decided against it. As long as we screen it, I say leave it open to who ever to add. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No need in leaving some one out that could be helpful. If they are bad or a problem, then they can get the axe
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I figured you would have surged ahead of me.  We only did 1 articuna raid.  I called Daniel a casual cause he didn't realize there was a gym close to where we go at lake martin..lol 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R I didnt buy a single pass for articuno. I did my free 6 on mine and was done. I forgot to lucky egg on two of them :/
Cindy R  ----->  Aww.. that stinks!  I hate when I do that!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ill try to pick it up!
Cindy R  ----->  Lol, I guess we better stop being so dang casual lately.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im wasting too much time trying to get gold on gyms
Cindy R  ----->  It's a hard choice...float in the water or play pokemon...poor pokemon just cant win that battle. LOL

Yea, we are at least done with the gold gym battle.  We take Montgomery about once a week these days. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im about done. Only being a bully bc Sam told me too haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Michelle U congratulations!
Michelle U  ----->  Thank you! 😊
Keaton Rhea  ----->  For those in the group wondering, Michelle got engaged
Michelle U  ----->  How did you find out! At first I thought you were congratulating me on something Pokemon related 😅
Phil Pearson  ----->  Manta knows all
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I know all
Michelle U  ----->  Lol ok I guess that explains it
Cindy R  ----->  Congratulations @Michelle U !!
Michelle U  ----->  Thanks @Cindy R ! 😊
Darren May  ----->  Tomorrow should be fun for casual Darren
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’ve got a three excellent in my backlog....I’ve choked three times now. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  And at this point I can’t trash it and give up 
Darren May  ----->  It’s all a matter of patience and getting the right Pokémon...says the guy who had to trash a 3 great throws in a row quest he choked on several times today to get the excellent quest 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’ve had the right Pokémon 4 times actually...twice with Wailmer and then I caught it and twice with Regiice and me choking. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  It doesn’t help that I don’t have raids or any poke hunting this summer 
Cindy R  ----->  Those make me want to throw my phone...hahaha...I swear its a conspiracy...after I finally throw 3 in a row and collect it I  start throwing them everytime...until the next quest for them pops up.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have the same three quests as Darren which means I have to force my kids do a raid with me tomorrow because I highly doubt I will get the three excellents in a row. 😂
Darren May  ----->  Literally 3 times in the past week I’ve planned on doing a tier 3 by the office just to use my pass and it has been jolteon each time
Ian Fraser  ----->  Time to take those Groudons to 40! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May Back to the go plus vs. gotcha conversation I thought of something you might want to consider. The go plus buzzes loudly and my husband HATES it!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes the buzzing is very loud. Especially on a wooden table or any other hard surface. I clip it to my pants pocket instead of a wrist strap. If it wasnt loud I would miss it some times
Sam Kawell  ----->  The same can be said for my wife. Not that she buzzes, but that the buzzing annoys her
Amanda  ----->  When you throw an excellent on a spearow and a Pika then go for the seedot you always hit them on and choke...you say f it and find a machamp raid. ✅3 excellents ✅crappy Larvitar 
Amanda  ----->  Was it even worth the stress? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😂@amanda I’ll probably end up trashing mine. Excellents are rare for me. 
Amanda  ----->  Let someone do it at the next raid!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Of course I threw two in a row today on Ethan’s account with the iPad. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can do it on regice on my phone easily if any one needs help. Its hit or miss on other phones for me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I did one on a single charmander once. First two quick catch, then nanab for final throw
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its all muscle memory
Darren May  ----->  Just choked on a 3rd regice throw myself. So the gotcha doesn’t vibrate at all?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That I don’t know Darren. Pete has one though. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dont think so. Just auto spin/catch
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If in range, go for it
Darren May  ----->  The gotcha sounds better but I’m leaning towards the go plus since it’s licensed and cheaper
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  But go plus does this
Amanda  ----->  I want a gotcha for when I wouldn’t even be paying attention to Pokémon anyway and a go plus for when I am actively playing.
Amanda  ----->  The go plus is obvious when you’re with people who don’t play like Elizabeth and Keaton says because it’s vibration could be loud.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Keven balked at the cost of the go plus so I’m sure he would have thought the gotcha was ridiculous. I couldn’t believe he actually bought me another one when I left mine on the hood of my car and ran over it. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Who is Allie?
Darren May  ----->  Yeah I get an allowance of $30 per month of discretionary funding (assuming no unexpected expenses) so I like the go plus price point. I can buy one tomorrow and be ready for my trip to dc at the beginning of August
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I love it when we’re traveling!  I actually bought mine specifically for a trip to Chicago in the fall. I was able to walk around and catch/spin stops without having my face in my phone all the time.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I play manually when traveling. Carroll gets mad as days use the plus haha
Darren May  ----->  God bless you @Ian Fraser 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well they need to learn to get better. I only get peeved when they say something that’s wrong, get told it’s wrong, and then say they’re still right. Cough Kento cough 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don’t remember Seedot nesting though. But then I didn’t know Sentret did either 
Darren May  ----->  I actually updated the nest atlas today. She had it marked as furret and it was definitely bellsprout
Ian Fraser  ----->  This just in: the entire world is a Pidgey nest 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Every time I see Taylor P like something I have a split second where I think it’s @Taylor Pruitt 
Darren May  ----->  My daughter asked me at community day why he wasn’t wearing a shirt. That was a good conversation. At least she didn’t notice his nipple rings
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The questions get much harder than that Darren. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Yes, as soon as a direct conversation starts.....oh ok then....lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We'll just call him spirited.
David Busby  ----->  Honestly I’m semi proud of Taylor p keeping it mostly pg. I didn’t even say anything to him. Figured I’d cross that bridge if we got there cause I really didn’t wanna have that convo
Amanda  ----->  What kills me is people telling people to keep it oh in big chat then me sssshhhhhing them at a raid for dropping the f bomb in front of kids standing at a raid.....
Amanda  ----->  *pg
Amanda  ----->  There are no kids in big chat...
Ian Fraser  ----->  I wish I could say I wasn’t guilty of that unintentionally...😔 I try to watch it if I noticed but I haven’t payed enough attention in the past every time 
David Busby  ----->  She might be talking about me...
Amanda  ----->  Nope...
David Busby  ----->  Oh well you’ve definitely had to shhh me before 
Amanda  ----->  Lol...yes
Amanda  ----->  But it does baffle me fr fr. The only time I’ve been uncomfortable in big chat is the first time Taylor P was in there. Other than that...I’ve actually made it more uncomfortable than most🤷🏻‍♀️
David Busby  ----->  Dms are for more than sliding into was one of the most liked comments in old group 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think Holden Hill is a kid. 
Amanda  ----->  Taylor P is just himself now. I accept him for who he is. Blue nails for Articuno and all
Amanda  ----->  Parker deserved that comment...
David Busby  ----->  Oh it was a goat comment I’d have liked it four or five times if I could
Amanda  ----->  How old is Holden?
David Busby  ----->  Is it a kid or is it the kids mom?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It has his name and picture. I’m pretty sure he’s younger than Kaitlin 
Amanda  ----->  The one I let play on my account at Felton until he started using my stardust?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t know anything about that Amanda.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s his pic
Amanda  ----->  Hmmmm....
Sam Kawell  ----->  Completely changing the subject, I was able to recreate the shiny rate graphs I found on reddit with the correct chance of encountering them that the silph road discovered. I'll only post this hear, because it only seemed to confuse people in the main chat...
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wild encounters:
Sam Kawell  ----->  Legendary Raids:
David Busby  ----->  So my 4 cunos after 30 raids is approximately 4% if I’m reading this correctly
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yep. I didn't quite believe you when you said you got 4
David Busby  ----->  Myself and Rachel did
Sam Kawell  ----->  Dang. I was happy to get one
Ian Fraser  ----->  I think the best thing about pg in group chat is that it keeps us from being overrun with very non pg language constantly. 

Yea Cuno was like 1/30 irrc so 4/30 is pretty nuts.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Honestly I think you should just post this in big chat next time someone brings up shinies and watch people’s minds melt. 
David Busby  ----->  I swear the rng on shinies doesn’t feel like true rng. It’s streaky as hell to the point where I start questioning the odds behind my streaks continuously happening. I got 4 cuno then 10 non glasses shiny squirtles. Also I got 3 shiny karp in one week.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Y’all are a bunch of nerds. Just looking at that graph gives me a headache 😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  There’s nothing wrong with being a nerd though. We need you in this world!
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think I totally will. I'll post it with no explanation and then go silent.
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost but you have to agree that it is very pretty
Sam Kawell  ----->  even if you don't understand it
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby I think that's just randomness, because nothing can explain Dee and his luck
David Busby  ----->  That’s literally the other reason I don’t think it’s rng
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The colors are very nice @Sam Kawell 
David Busby  ----->  And what infuriates me about dee is that he doesn’t seem to understand how unnatural it is. I’d really dislike him if he wasn’t so goddamn nice 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Honestly it’s a fantastic graph. The only thing I would do is remove the n=x and just say Shiny’s encountered=x. But that’s only to increase layman understanding. 
David Busby  ----->  Why do people get so confused over n tho
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I guess if I really thought hard about it I could figure it out I just don’t want to. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  That would make it clear, but it would totally clutter up the graph. Maybe if I defined N on the margins?
Ian Fraser  ----->  I got 2 shiny cunos over 12 raids and then 1 non glasses Squirtle playing for an hour and a half. Catie got two within 20 mins. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nah. the only reason I would do that is because it’s intuitive to look at the body of the graph first before you look at the margins. If you look at the header it’s pretty obvious what n is 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser what about this?
Ian Fraser  ----->  People get confused over n because it can mean different things depending on what you’re representing. So you have to refer to something else to see what that thing is. For people who like that stuff it’s easy. For people who don’t it can cloud understanding. @David Busby 

all in my opinion anyway. nothing wrong with thinking otherwise. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea, that’s probably perfect. Best of both worlds.
David Busby  ----->  Ok what even changed lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  Question: why did N=6 and N=1 shift positions slightly when you changed it? Is the n=x for each band one big text box? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  The n=0 says what n is. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  It's the best way I could mass produce these graphs. I use a function in Matlab that allows me to manually place each of the "N = x" text boxes. But it doesn't save, so I have to replace them every time I run the script
David Busby  ----->  Oh yea nice work on the graph I can read em but making them isn’t my forte
Sam Kawell  ----->  Making pretty graphs about pogo is super fun for me. If you have any requests, know that I find them a delightful challenge
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oof, MatLab. You can’t specify a position on the graph for them to be? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I've found that control to be more difficult than manually placing them. Maybe I just don't understand it enough.
David Busby  ----->  How many casuals does it take for a regice vs the probability of kentoos accounts not getting in
Ian Fraser  ----->  Fair enough. I’ve never worked in MatLab I’ve just heard stories from my Dad. I think Python’s MatPlotLib is similar (though maybe expanded?) functionality though. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  10 casuals - 0 for each of his accounts that don’t get in since he doesn’t contribute much anyway. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby that's probly not a graph just "too many" and "maybe half?"
David Busby  ----->  You said you liked a challenge 🤷‍♂️
Sam Kawell  ----->  Speaking of casuals, I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but it seems like the raid chat is being flooded with casuals. Like more so than usual
David Busby  ----->  Also I really really need a dps graph comparing aggron to the supreme counter 
David Busby  ----->  Way more so than usual. And talkative casuals that don’t know crap
David Busby  ----->  Supreme counter to current t5 that is 
Ian Fraser  ----->  You’re not crazy. I dunno what happened, but it’s so many. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Agron IS the supreme counter 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'll throw that together tomorrow. It'll be funny
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Thanks @Michelle U !!!
Ian Fraser  ----->  (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Also I never told you, congrats on the engagement!
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt why did you choose to be named Stan and be level 33-34?
Michelle U  ----->  ... did I miss something here.. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  He probably got the egg that hatched that from you. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Sam Kawell Wanted to have a little fun with the casuals, that’s all. Nothing malicious 😬
Sam Kawell  ----->  Haha, fair enough. I was just confused.
Michelle U  ----->  Yeah your pic confused me too. So was the egg really from Tampa ? 😃
Michelle U  ----->  Ahhh so cool!! Too bad I can't open my own gifts! 😆
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Michelle U its best to open gifts from far away, then trade what ever comes out (unless its a hundo like that vulpix) with something a friend caught locally. It gets more distance and that friend can get 3 candies of whatever they trade (like a bad drat or larv).
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Idk if you realized that or not
Michelle U  ----->  Haha yes I have been trying to save gifts from farther away when I have slots. But if i was carrying a perfect vulpix around I'd rather have that 😍😍
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes me too. I couldnt stand waiting so I traded for one. Horrible IVs but its mine
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Having only my infinity incubator sucks
Michelle U  ----->  Surprised you found someone to trade with! I would never want to part with mine
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And they had to give up 16k dust!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But neither me or Lee need any dust haha. He is over 2M and im at like 1.7M. Plus he hatched a better one already
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Speaking of trading, I still have lots of Hawaii mons to trade 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think I still have a few as well. I gave Lee and Jin a bunch the other day tho
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, since I’m summer casual and was out of town for a week I haven’t seen many people. And I forgot about the HI ones when I was trading with Leslie the other day. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive started labeling all mine as 'trade' and adding city name to end if distance
Michelle U  ----->  It would be really great if we could sort by distance. I went thru my whole dex trying to find things I caught in Canada last year😆
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve just been naming by place but I should probably do that @Keaton Rhea 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I trashed most of mine from Canada/Maine :( I’ve only got two left. 
Michelle U  ----->  Same :( didn't ever think distance would be important so transferred most :(
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m gonna need your thoughts on big chat @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  I’m going to pass right now. Navigating in Atlanta and I don’t have the energy 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea checking GM is not worth it in ATL traffic. It’s a good read. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost I like being able to search one word and see them all. But yes they need moee filters for pokemon AND friends list @Michelle U 
Ian Fraser  ----->  They need A filter for the damn friends list. Have to scroll down three pages to find Catie because she doesn’t check her app every day. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was sending about 70 gifts a day but ive given up. Takes so damn long to scroll
Sam Kawell  ----->  The real question is how does she not check her app every day...
Ian Fraser  ----->  Casual life. That’s how she got a perfect Mew. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  She in NJ w/ family atm, so not able to play most of the time. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So how do we get the raid chat back to an actual raid chat?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Get GORT to eliminate all casuals. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dont know but its guaranteeing I get zero work done this morning
Ian Fraser  ----->  Same. Oh wait, I have no work since 9am. Sigh. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have tons to do. 2 papers and a white paper coming up. But I cant help myself and read up
Ian Fraser  ----->  Difference between paper and white paper...? 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Yes I'm curious too lol.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’s killing me that I can’t read up right now. I did catch that trendsdale is having trouble at Felton 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  One is a conference paper, one is a journal paper. A white paper is like a very short proposal (ie beg for monies to do specific research)
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Consider me educated this morning lol. Breaks over back to work i go.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May @Elizabeth Kidd Yost get excited for another larv quest!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I still have the first one 😩
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just beat them both at the same time!
Sam Kawell  ----->  I need the Manta bot in hville
Sam Kawell  ----->  😥
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Idk how well the manta bot would perform in HSV. Stops are so far apart
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, my drive home passes one gym and no pokestops. I have to drive out of the way to hit 6 stops and 2 gyms.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah outside of bridge st and BSP, I have no idea where to play
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May extra thicc ursang in front of pharm building
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The easiest thing to hit excellent throws on I've seem
Phil Pearson  ----->  @Michelle U Add me and get Aussie eggs! 0337 5965 2932
Michelle U  ----->  sent you a request! how long are you in Australia for?
Phil Pearson  ----->  3 years!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Holy Crap. I didn't know you were leaving for so long
Michelle U  ----->  Wow ! Maybe in a couple years you can send us alolan kangaskhan 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No alolan yet lol @Michelle U 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just mega form
Michelle U  ----->  "Yet" ;)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mega is throw baby in pouch out to fight
Michelle U  ----->  I can hope lol. That's probably the only way I'll get one haha. 
Michelle U  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I bet you've had so many offers for yours
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Zero so far. It's hot garbage. It's from london so super rare
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was super into living dex but my box is in bad shape all the time
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So I think im gonna stop
Phil Pearson  ----->  @Sam Kawell Yeah I’m here for a PhD 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dr. Phil and Dr. Manta in coming!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh and not that Dr. Phil. This is the cool one
Phil Pearson  ----->  I won’t listen to your problems
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wasnt expecting you to haha
Phil Pearson  ----->  Unless they’re lizard problems 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like lizards. But I could only answer electronics questions
Phil Pearson  ----->  Well now I know who to go to
Keaton Rhea  ----->  IT, im useless. Custom design? Im good to go
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mostly do analog electronic realization of ideal nonlinear dynamical systems
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That means I make ideal maths into hardware
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I just came across an ursaring, got in 1 excellent throw and the darn thing fled 😠 
Darren May  ----->  Do I was in Atlanta most of the day and then came home and had to mow the yard. Anyone want to summarize the day’s events bc there is no way I’m going to scroll through the big group?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Tl;dr level 28 Instinct who’s never talked before spammed chat telling what gyms he was going to. So he runs into Lee’s 3k Blissey at Felton. Doesn’t understand basics of how the game works, can’t take down a Blissey, even though it hasn’t been berried. Will has a good bit of fun trolling until Jazzy of all people tells him to not put gyms in big chat. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  This exchange was pretty great. The most on point thing Kento has ever said. 
Darren May  ----->  Where are all these casuals coming from?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  There about 7 new faces at the museum tonight 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So Pogo just tweeted a picture with the gen 4 starters...
Darren May  ----->  Gardevoir is on the photo too. Ralts August community day confirmed!!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Doesn’t gardevoir have another form in gen 4?
David Busby  ----->  Gallade
David Busby  ----->  Male only
David Busby  ----->  And seriously what the hell is up with the casuals
David Busby  ----->  I thought we decided the Tuscaloosa douchebags did us a favor by weeding out the casuals
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well part of it’s Will’s fault. 
David Busby  ----->  I’m listening
David Busby  ----->  Blaming will for things is fun
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  True, but today was hilarious!
Ian Fraser  ----->  I feel like it’s early to release gen 4 though...I think I would prefer more like an October release. That would make it a year from gen 3. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean he said he was trying to make big chat more lit for Racheal. 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  Trolling these super new casuals is way to easy. 
David Busby  ----->  Oh I thought we were blaming Will for the appearance of the casuals 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh. I mean he did only show up again like a month ago...three weeks later we’re flooded with casuals. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m in a couple Pokémon Facebook groups for Virginia and S. Florida and there are a lot of new people in those groups too. I think it’s funny that I’m one of the most knowledgeable people in there because I ask you guys stupid questions all the time 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  Tinfoil hat time: all the new casuals are will’s Pidgeys. That would explain some of the things they say after all. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Haha yea I think part of that is the college town @Elizabeth Kidd Yost . More of a definite nerd concentration. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  This is one from tonight. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean I’m sure that was a TSR post....9+ months ago 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost holding the fort down haha
Darren May  ----->  Casual alert: I went to sleep without opening any gifts yesterday. Sorry friends 😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I berried that gym until I got gold last night! Can’t believe we’ve held it for so long. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Keven just told me that War Eagle Way is going to be closed for three weeks at the end of the month. That’s going to make it really hard for us non campus people to get to Cary 😭
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May just for that you got passed by my brother on my friends list. Get comfortable at #4 now
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I just realized that my maiden name is on my name in this group 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  How far up war eagle eay @Elizabeth Kidd Yost ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Way
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive forgot to open gifts two nights now @Darren May 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Lowder parking lot will not be accessible via War Eagle Way. Their going to send them down the concourse to get there. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh that sounds like fun.... I am guessing the village lot will b fine tho?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think so. They are closing it so they can connect utilities to the building.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ah ok. Makes sense
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Do you have a brother? Named Nathaniel?
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell I had a sad realization the other day that we are working very hard to build our friendship levels with people we may never see in person to trade or raid with again. 😢
Sam Kawell  ----->  Shhhhhhh, I just try not to think about it.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt Nope. I’m not related to Jason Kidd either 😜
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May I know it’s silly, but I feel the need for my friendships in Pogo to reflect my actual friendships even though I don’t necessarily see or raid with those people very often. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea I had that realization adding some people from Birmingham...100,000 xp tho.....
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Ian Fraser @Sam Kawell not trying to steal your thunder on being on top of the breaking news or anything 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean I don’t actually care who posts it 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh I totally do
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Anyone else want to post it in big group?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Maybe this will be the Leafeon and Glaceon release? Seems like a super convenient time to do it. 
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea ..there goes my stardust..I have one of my 100 eevees powered up but have another one and a couple 98 and 96's I have been hanging onto..lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gotta grind it back up
Cindy R  ----->  The story of my life..LOL
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don’t think this guy understand what a pattern is....
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Yeah I’m not seeing it. Also thinking about calling him out on “that’s how I predicted this would be eevee”
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I used to like seeing what was in the main chat through out the day but I think I'm going to have to mute it.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Never once did I hear anyone say they thought this would be eevee. And going back and trying to explain it after the fact is certainly not predicting 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean you’re right. But I don’t care about him saying he totally guessed right, I care about him saying that because he guessed right he now knows what every other comm day will be. 
Darren May  ----->  I was about to check in to say that niantic needs to cool it with the b2b Saturday/Sunday events but then realized I’ll be out of town. RIP
Darren May  ----->  *sigh*
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dislike
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If it makes you feel any better @Darren May , you are still at the top of my list even tho you forgot to open gifts
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Don t sigh @Darren May took me 3 tripinch and 1 mareep before 10k #5 gave me lavitar.....candie...but still.
David Busby  ----->  Do we punish kentoo for not being able to scroll up three lines
Darren May  ----->  Fighting so hard not to respond “scroll up bro”
David Busby  ----->  Oh I’m sorry 6 lines. It was literally on the top of his screen
Sam Kawell  ----->  Will just called him out
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Chansey quest at dorm next to cater hall
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And the frat house cannon is drat
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The tower out on shell toomer near the college and 85 intersection is another chansey
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just re posting
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I’m guessing that dorm is not reachable from the car?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope. Its the one between haley and cater hall on the upper quad
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would park on the loop next to foy hall or onnthe centennial garden loop and walk over
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's that stop
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was thinking by Foy. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So... Is the new ultra box really that good?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was not even going to consider ir at first but now I have 2 chansey quests and zero incubators. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I feel like everything will pale compared to that one amazing box a few months ago
Sam Kawell  ----->  At least drunk David thinks so
Sam Kawell  ----->  *thought
David Busby  ----->  Dude 24 passes for only 1400 coins he’ll yea
Amanda  ----->  🤔🤔is my box different ??
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I only value raid passes right now so its not really a deal. But those 2 chansey quests I have right now are gonna kill me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda he is not taking about the current box. He is talking about the one david got like 4? Times
Amanda  ----->  Oh the ones when him and Joe accumulated over 100 premiums??
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. Those
Keaton Rhea  ----->  ive not bought a box since
Amanda  ----->  Me either until today.
Amanda  ----->  Incubators. I need that Pichu. Gotta get rid of these 5, 7 and 10’s....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Me too....
Amanda  ----->  I’m still being conservative 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I actually spent real money on a box last time for the incubators. Since I wasn’t here to do raids I wanted to capitalize on the extra xp for hatches. Usually I only buy if I have money from surveys. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm actually kind of done with the 7ks. Now that I have all of them, I see no reason to limit myself to that pool of mediocre pokes
Phil Pearson  ----->  Same here @Sam Kawell. And the first one I hatched was a event pichu 
David Busby  ----->  Still need my effing vulpix then I’ll be done
Phil Pearson  ----->  I’d like another vulpix. I’ve gotten one and it was trash
Sam Kawell  ----->  I hear some Asian dude named Stan got a perfect the other day
Cindy R  ----->  We are headed to the beach...not to far, but at least our eggs won't be local tomorrow. 
Darren May  ----->  @Amanda Late to the game but you can have my event pichu if you want it
Cindy R  ----->  Pretty excited about the situation 
Amanda  ----->  @Darren May Thanks! Adam has 3 already though. I’m thinking about trading all 3 while he sleeps.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  David I’ll trade 😊
David Busby  ----->  I don’t wanna take your only one tho
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You wouldn’t be
David Busby  ----->  😳
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I walked everyday when we were at my mom’s and had nine eggs incubating all week 🤷🏼‍♀️
Ian Fraser  ----->  O_O Holy crap. @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I got this one from Phil. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wait that means you’ve hatched 4 right? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve hatched 4 grimers also. I think I’ve hatched 45 Alolan eggs. 
Phil Pearson  ----->  I’ve hatched a little over 100 alolan eggs and one stinking vulpix
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Someone needs this
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That stinks Phil!
Phil Pearson  ----->  This was a frustrating hatch -__-
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Ok clearly there’s a lot happening today I don’t know about. Alolan diglett, Lugia raids, shiny pliable and Minun....what else?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Random rare pokes spawning
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, I now know what it feels like to be Dee. This was the first minun I clicked on for this event.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Yeah I’ve seen a trapinch and a lotad in the half mile I’ve driven so figured something like that 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Swinub is pretty common. Make sure to pinap those in prep for mamoswine
Ian Fraser  ----->  Implying that we haven’t already hatched a billion swinub. 😐
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I know, but the evo will prob go to 100 for third stage
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And I wasted a ton of candies for my ixe badge during winter event
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ice badge
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Did a Lugia raid on K’s account and shefot an effin shiny just like her first ho-oh raid 😫
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well she will b able to trade eventually!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yeah in two years!
Darren May  ----->  Are the shiny rates higher for this weekend? I got a shiny plusle and minum and snookems got 2 minims and a plusle on 1 trip from our house and around the museum 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And it’s a 93%. Some kids get all the luck. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May yes the rates are higher for this weekend. Plus, the fact that they are common, makes them easier to get
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Kinda like the rosialia window
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Casual question. Can I trade a higher lvl poke than a person can achieve. Like can I trade a lvl 40 poke to a lvl 35 trainer?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  How difficult have they been?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The shiny? @Daniel R 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Can 5 do the raid you know our 3 and 2 level 30?
David Busby  ----->  Probably not 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh lugia is hard. Dont try
David Busby  ----->  No @Keaton Rhea 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Always out of town here lately lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks! I just thought of that and was like I better not power up anything to save it for trades
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I doubt it. I lost a pass this morning bc casuals wouldn’t believe me when I said we didn’t have enough with 5. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I lost lugia with 10 back when it was first released. It's one of the hardest raid bosses. 
David Busby  ----->  I think a four man is possible
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
David Busby  ----->  Five strong accounts can do it iirc 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes from big boys/girls. Not pleb army
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’s all good. I was being nice. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would say lugia is harder than regice bc top counter for TDO is ttar (non hydro). Most dont have smack down
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Everyone (well here in this group) got a champ army
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Was that at Veterans?
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Keaton Rhea You can trade higher but it auto levels it down 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What happened?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sorry was that to me or @Elizabeth Kidd Yost ? 😅
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nothing is at vets now. Im in the gym
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  When you failed Lugia with ten?  Was that at vets?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ohhh no. Sorry misunderstood. It was at waterfall with filthy causals. I had at least 10 lvls on the ppl I was with and I still didnt have a a good ttar army yet
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The first one I did was at vets with 10 or 11 people and we failed. The only person I knew at that time was Leslie so I was just wondering if you were there. 
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I’m assuming raikou is still king but does smackdown take over my zapdos and mewtwo?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby  rai still big boy. zap, then mewtwo, then smack ttar. Just DPS wise
David Busby  ----->  Gamepress is fucking with me then 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gamepress has no idea. Check the site I told you about lol. I trust that over that garbage
Keaton Rhea  ----->  4 man should b possible with lvl 40 flawless rai. Maybe a flawless zap or two sprinkled in. Plus maz revive
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Max
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  What is this site you speak of Keaton?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh sorry
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dominikzen.com
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's how I make my spread sheets lol. Im not really that smart 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its one of the better resource for focusing on max DPS. I dont care about revives, potions, TDO, etc.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I still delete almost all my max revives. I think I need to change to only using them and delete all potions and normal revives
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve been keeping max revives and dumping the others for bag space.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I do that. But I also dump 50 to 100 max at a time... I know im 'gym casual' but what do I use it on
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Realistically, ive deleted at least 1k max revives. Who knows on the mac and hyper potions or normal revives.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Was the event just for today?
Darren May  ----->  Tomorrow too I think.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes tomorrow too
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We're about an hour and a half from the house so we might have to come alive by noon tomorrow if anyone's going to be raiding.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Also if I sent you an egg today or tomorrow they are from mobile. I know all I send tomorrow will be
Darren May  ----->  Hey there is a double candy event coming up right? I’ve got to clear out my box for all my upcoming go plus action in dc 
David Busby  ----->  Yea but it’s event so might only be hatch, catch and not transfer 
Darren May  ----->  Crap you’re right. Graphic is only hatch and catch 
David Busby  ----->  Us waiting for double candy to transfer is futile IMO. They don’t want us to have legendary candy without raiding for it or using rares. I think it’s the only reason we can’t throw them in gyms to berry cause nothing is as good as blissey
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Amanda are y'all doing them all?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m hoping to join at the museum. 
Darren May  ----->  Yeah what time is museum? I might be able to make those
Amanda  ----->  @Daniel R Sorry. Just saw this. No we got pizza and going home to dust more🤗🤗🤗
Amanda  ----->  😑rather be raiding...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We're to tired to do them all lol. Just going to hit Zion on the way home ourselves.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Finally got my three excellents in a row!  I pulled into Parkway Baptist to spin the stop and three wailers spawned! Nailed it!
Ian Fraser  ----->  I have dreams that’s someday I’ll see three wailmers in a row. At this rate that’ll be the only way I’ll do it. Choked on Drowzee and Lugia today after two in a row. 
Phil Pearson  ----->  Kangaskans are the bestttt for throwing excellents 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Thanks for your input Phil
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So is there some glitch with encounters?  I tried to claim one of larvitar encounters and it just disappeared without giving me the encounter. I’ve closed and restarted the app twice and nothing 😠
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :( sorry Elizabeth
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I really hoped it just appeared in your inventory
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Encounters are super bugged right now. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Holy crap that’s a terrible feeling I’m sorry @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I checked my inventory and didn’t see one. I’m afraid to claim the other one. I haven’t had any other issues with quests today. 
Darren May  ----->  Do you have any stacked encounters you haven’t claimed/caught yet?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Nope. I don’t do that. 
Darren May  ----->  Oh dang
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Looking at it again, it looks like one is stacked but I only clicked on one of them. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I hope that is the larv!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t know why it only showed one, but it did give me both. Phew!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Good!
David Busby  ----->  @Daniel R YOU HAVE A PERFECT ZERO SHINY
David Busby  ----->  I WANT IT 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Speaking of bad pokes, look at this find
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, are all alolan digletts female?
David Busby  ----->  Bro your candy situation
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I'm casual now
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Nope I got some males too
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Several 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  As I'm looking @Sam Kawell mine are 6 and 6 male/ female 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have 5 male and 1 female. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hmm, literally all 8 of mine are female
Ian Fraser  ----->  oh dang this guy is lvl 33? Empty xp is real. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wow. I didn't realize that.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I just hope my message reaches all the noobs and they don't cave under the perfect IV pressure
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've switched to a new feeding buddy at sam harris
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea ...jelly of you khaun
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its legit too
Cindy R  ----->  That's awesome!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Terrible IVs but who cares
Cindy R  ----->  Exactly!
Phil Pearson  ----->  If I could give you candy I would @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wish! Im thinking about it being my next rare dump. Lvl 40 kanga in AU? Yes please
Phil Pearson  ----->  I think they’re probably the most useful regional 
Phil Pearson  ----->  Because move sets
Phil Pearson  ----->  But I’ve never used one for anything 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mine has never seen battle
David Busby  ----->  Who we making fun of for empty xp now?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Can I get some of that empty exp? Gotta beat Elizabeth to 40
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive got stardust to trade haha
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t think that’s going to be a problem Keaton!! It’s slow going for me these days. Wishing we got double xp on catches again instead of candy 😩
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You got a chance. I prob wont be able to play at all for next two days. Going out of town for NASA delivery
Cindy R  ----->  That's right @Keaton Rhea ...you just take a break for a couple days...LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nooooooooo
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I cleared out box space. Im back to lucky egg evo sessions
Cindy R  ----->  I haven't done an evolve in soo long..lol. you will certainly catch me that way.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Prob not....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Most my exp comes from evo
Cindy R  ----->  I feel like this number should be higher...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Me too...
Cindy R  ----->  Ohhh....I have catching to do!! Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is 2M diff in exp evos only too btw
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only 1,856 eggs hatched. 48,883 stops.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have to catch trash and evo it to keep up
Cindy R  ----->  I've got:
Eggs 3,410
Stops 52,223
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You got wayyyy more eggs.
Cindy R  ----->  Those super incubators get me...lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The amount of times ive done chansey quests with 5km+ eggs and only infinite incubators is too high
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im thinking about doing my 10k during event with just infinity one haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have some super saved up. Just dont wan a waste
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wanna
Cindy R  ----->  Yea, I have made myself cut back on hatches. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You can always add to my hatches! Just gimme those incubators! :)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They wont go to waste
Cindy R  ----->  You got me there...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My egg to km walked is prob my worst stat in game. I always incubate. Hust never have extras
Cindy R  ----->  Lol only 579 tiny rats for me and 1022 research 

It took forever to get that rat badge!
Cindy R  ----->  You got me by 1 in the kanto region..lol. I only have 150! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I feel ya there
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, I might be able to catch up a little. 
Cindy R  ----->  39 was torture...lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Cindy R when did you get to 40?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I don't want them but you can't have them #level40life
David Busby  ----->  Where’s that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Both cindy and Daniel beat me for sure @Sam Kawell I was at least 2M behind at that point
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Tallassee
Cindy R  ----->  Daniel said around last Oct..lol. I can't remember.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  There were only a few to hit 40 before us.
Sam Kawell  ----->  That's what I thought
Sam Kawell  ----->  Did anyone hit 40 in 2016 in Auburn?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I hit I hit right b4 dec or maybe start of dec
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jay Wilson was fast but he is really Columbus. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And not legit
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jazzy, matt, Sharon were fast too
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  At least you always saw Sharon 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think people are lying about how they traded and got a perfect. 200 in 2 days of trading and all were much worse IVs.
Darren May  ----->  Shocker but I haven’t been paying much attention since most of the stuff I’ve been trading has been trash for distance. I figure it is similar to how I’ve never had a 💯 legendary from a raid but others have so I assume I must just be unlucky 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I dunno about 💯 but I traded a Tyrouge to someone I just became friends with and the IV improved rather dropped which should have been unlikely...some people just have all the luck. 
David Busby  ----->  I ran into jarel at the museum and told him we should just trade instead of gifts. He gave me a 98 weedle I think it was from some trash
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive only traded for distance maybe 25 or so times. Ive received mostly trash drat and larvs to give the other person 3 candies and all of them got significantly worse. 
Amanda  ----->  Adam and I have had a few of the ones we traded get better, but 93 was the best. 
Darren May  ----->  They’ve made it so tedious to prevent cheating and exploitation (which is fine I guess) that I really don’t care for it. I just trade with Snookems so that we don’t have to send each other gifts 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I guess that's what I'm missing. I'm not checking the trash. Just semi relevant high cp ones. We're holding onto several relevant high cp till we hit ultra. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Don’t you have an unknown @Michelle U ? 
Michelle U  ----->  No, I was at work when the one showed up in auburn 😣
Michelle U  ----->  They tried calling me to log in for me but it was busy
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh dang I’m sorry. Well IEJohnson in Mystic went to GoFest so he has a whole lot of unknowns. Might be willing to trade you for not much. @Michelle U 
Michelle U  ----->  Oh Ok! Maybe I'll ask him then, thanks! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  There’s no reason to keep slugma candies right?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No marcargo is useless @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I regret not getting that second unown that spawned in AU
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s what I thought @Keaton Rhea just wanted to be sure before I mass evolved some 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes that is about all you can do.  A think a perfect lvl 30 one is around 1.3k CP
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I know she chats a lot but that's too many people commenting on what seemed harmless. At least it was raid related and trying to get others to join. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean spamming about the same raid is always annoying. And honestly Parker was incredibly nice about asking them to not lol. Shockingly nice. Like I’m debating asking if he’s okay. 
David Busby  ----->  Ok if Adam and lee hadn’t just roasted Amanda that would have been the funniest shit I read all dat
Amanda  ----->  I just really don’t even know what happened.
Amanda  ----->  I just was commenting back to Will’s comment because I did scroll up some 🤷🏻‍♀️ just not enough.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I really don’t want them in mystic chat. Is that terrible?  I feel bad for adding her to the Opelika group. 
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Now you know the great burden of being in the mystic Illuminati 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I say we just don’t bring it up. They don’t seem all that interested so maybe it won’t be an issue. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost they get on my nerves a lot too. Not a fan. But hey, look at kento. He has not been that bad. I am more concerned about how much they spam chat
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm not quite up for scrolling up today, who are we not wanting in the chat?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The black suns
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ah. He really does post alot
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There is more than one. Black sparkly sun 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes. I can’t handle them spamming mystic chat too. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I only can find one. They have two accounts in the GroupMe?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  His wife is Jessica Dugas
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ah, I didn't see Jessica.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Kinda hard to miss earlier in the day
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also they’ve both told not-so-subtly said that big chat is sexist when someone suggests they do something differently. Not sure I’m a fan of that in Mystic chat. We’re here to learn and to help noobs and part of learning is learning how to cooperate with the rest of chat. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think I miss the sexist thing, but 4 pics in a row for a single raid is a bit excessive. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  David just told her that people don’t usually call out level 2 raids and he later said he would keep it PG if people respected the ladies. It was subtle. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh yeah sorry I missed that
Ian Fraser  ----->  What Elizabeth said. I didn’t think it was that subtle mostly because it’s a Pokémon GroupMe of all things but otherwise, I agree. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t know what he was referring to when he said it. Or maybe I just hadn’t figured out their relationship yet. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  It was directly in regards to David telling her we don’t usually call out tier 1/2 raids, I guess? I scrolled all the way back to it...and now my thumbs hurt 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sorry for all that data guys 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I appreciate your dedication to the truth @Ian Fraser and I actually just did the same... I started getting your screenshots just as I got there
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I did read the first part but missed second part when it happened
Ian Fraser  ----->  😂 I’m so sorry. It was so far back. 
David Busby  ----->  Second part was today when they kept spamming fire station raid and Parker, myself and Ross said something about it 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I remembered his comment, but I didn't get that it was not so subtly about David.
Sam Kawell  ----->  But now it's pretty obvious
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think I missed the middle part of that when it happened. Thanks Ian. 
Darren May  ----->  Like I seriously have stopped raiding during the week bc I don’t want to try and coordinate with casuals
Ian Fraser  ----->  While I totally understand that and the current batch of casuals seems very...talkative and...numerous, that I’m okay with. It’s being contentious that I’m definitely not. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  But for real, where did all the casuals come from?? I swear we’ve grown 50+ in the past three weeks and they’re all sub 30
David Busby  ----->  Some of them are sub 23
David Busby  ----->  So after posting the fake mystic group of alts, itsbearyo dmed me asking to be in the mystic group. I’m slightly skeptical of him being the next techvic after hitting level 36 in three weeks but that’s cause I got burned once. I figured this group decides whether he’s in real mystic or not before he gets trolled 
Amanda  ----->  I really have seen him circling the museum while he’s lured it up on multiple occasions now.
David Busby  ----->  As I said just skeptical af after being burned before on tv
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Pretty sure he did three raids with me on Sunday at the museum. Didn’t talk to him until the third, but I think he did all three. 
David Busby  ----->  He’s definitely raiding in auburn but did he get xp raiding as a spoofer or in a different city?
David Busby  ----->  For like two weeks he was in every gym I was in 
David Busby  ----->  I know he plays hardcore 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If he was playing when their was double and triple xp he probably could have done it. Didn’t you get over a million just on articuno day?
David Busby  ----->  I ended up sending this. Gonna ask about possible spoofing then add. If he’s been spoofing and admits to it I say he gets a probation in big group like cwest 
Sam Kawell  ----->  It would have still been difficult. He would have had to average over 350k per day. Not impossible, but probly a red flag
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would say its not impossible to do. When I was grinding go 40 on my hardcore days I prob getting 250k+ a day. I easily got around 3 lucky egg evo sessions plus a raid. I didnt use any premium items other than eggs and was not that efficient about raids
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I highly doubt a low to mid 30s is going to have the 5k pidgey candies, with 3k rat, sentret, caterpie, and weddle candies I did then.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Go plus users: does anyone know what 3 slow red flashes mean? Every once in a while it does it even when it is connected and working properly.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Out of red balls or space
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But mine doesnt do it when I have  sufficent space and balls
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Interruption in game signal @Sam Kawell when line does it usually stops are white and clicking on a gym or poke just freezes. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  When signal improves or you move away from prices lol it goes back to working.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hmm, it was only on pokestops and I wasn't spinning any of them at the time, but it worked before and afterwards. I guess it might have been the signal
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Tacorita is win a T3 or higher for drat encounter
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Daniel R that new zbragirl8 person choose a profile pic that looks very similar to yours. It's very confusing
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Hang on.......
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Oh I see. Let's see if I can be more original.....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Testing 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  How's that?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Very nice
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I an to please lol. If that's the most disruptive thing for the day that would be great. Of course with a full bag it wouldn't hurt my feelings if niantic said...surprise here's gene 4.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Is JerryB22 Adriana’s Dad?
David Busby  ----->  Yea
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That explains a lot
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Same......lovely personality.
Ian Fraser  ----->  I haven’t paid much attention to big chat today. Has anyone mentioned something about the EX raid pass wave that happened today? If not I might after raids are over for the day. It’d be a good illustration to the casuals why we’ve tried to set up a rotating schedule. 
David Busby  ----->  Nope 
David Busby  ----->  But it’d be a good idea 
Cindy R  ----->  @David Busby I was trying to come up with a nice way to say he!! No....bahaha
Ian Fraser  ----->  Missing anything? 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sounds good
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Uh oh. Jessica Sparkly Sun got level 30 today. 
Amanda  ----->  I don’t have to contemplate stealing Adam’s in his sleep anymore🤷🏻‍♀️
David Busby  ----->  Way to crap on my 205 cp I was super excited about 
Amanda  ----->  Sorry😔
David Busby  ----->  Oh I’m not salty about that now that I’ve seen the shiny
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Because it’s fun to make David salty...
Phil Pearson  ----->  Salt 
Darren May  ----->  Is it really an achievement to make @David Busby salty? Now if someone can make @Keaton Rhea salty...😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  Does anyone know if alolan Rattata count towards your tiny rat badge?
Ian Fraser  ----->  TSR says yes. Has to be below 2.41 kg
Sam Kawell  ----->  Just caught one that was 2.42...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip. Shouldnt you be close on thag badge? I feel like you could of caught enough just on campus bc of how common they are
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’s not an achievement @Darren May but it’s still fun. 😜
Amanda  ----->  @Sam Kawell They definitely do. Appraisal has to be tiniest not below average in size. Idk about the kg🤷🏻‍♀️
Sam Kawell  ----->  Thanks guys. Also, I'm going to be in Auburn this Saturday for Zapdos day. Did Mystics raid in a group last time?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We did for the most part but you know someone is always late lol.
Matt Inger  ----->  Spots goal post
Amanda  ----->  @Sam Kawell Also any xs rat you receive in a trade counts.
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser I don't think there is a set weight that's the cutoff. I think it's some combination of weight and height.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Little more digging, seem that it must be below 2.41kg but doesn’t always count. One sec and I’ll post TSR link. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/8v5sv0/what_are_the_technical_numbers_for_tiny_rat_big/?st=JJSWDGST&sh=b9dc387f
Ian Fraser  ----->  Not gonna lie though I’m a little confused since everything I can find seems to say that the cutoff is definitely 2.41kg. If it’s not working like that it might be worth gathering data on...
Sam Kawell  ----->  Interesting. So the "tiniest we've ever seen" is the misleading thing. I wonder why they didn't give the same criteria for both
Ian Fraser  ----->  Niantic and Spaghetti Code. Name a more iconic duo. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, they were saying the badge only depends on the weight, but the appraisal depend on a combination of both weight and height. I don't know how they know these things, but it doesn't make much sense
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well, apparently the xs badge itself is based on being 2.5 std dev from the mean according to an equation based on the base game Pokédex weight and height..? I think I’m reading this correctly anyway. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Quick qnd dirty. Is this consistent with what you looked at sam?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  TLDR; sunny: vena, exe, groud. Cloudy: champ. Rain: ogre. Other: champ/ogre.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I see someone testing felton
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, pretty much
Keaton Rhea  ----->  ill wait to see confirmation of regirock b4 I post else where
Sam Kawell  ----->  Okay, I was confused where people were getting that regirock was the next. I have seen anything yet.
Darren May  ----->  If you don’t mind I’m going to stay in denial until it’s a confirmed Regi. That will really push me into full casualdom
Ian Fraser  ----->  A couple of days ago they pushing an ingame notification that said something like “do you feel that rumble? Get Regiice before it’s gone on the 19th”

That’s why the suspicion is Regirock. 
Darren May  ----->  Or the rumble of shiny Groudon 
Darren May  ----->  !!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I get the suspicion, it just seems like people somehow knew
Ian Fraser  ----->  We can only hope. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh lol no. But if you say there’s a reason to think this will happen casuals think you said you know it will happen 
Darren May  ----->  Also tsr just went down. Coincidence?
Ian Fraser  ----->  It did? I can get on the site
Darren May  ----->  Not working for me. Maybe oit is tired of my F5-ing 
Ian Fraser  ----->  In theory you’re probably better off refreshing PokemonGo’s twitter. That was how I managed to post Eevee CD first. Assuming they formally announce it....which they’ve usually done by now. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Or sign up for Pogo Twitter notifications like I might have...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I wonder how long one person will sit there and battle Cindy's blissie. I'll give them props, it's been 20 minutes 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Good keep mav talking @Keaton Rhea huckleberrys time just reset for berring lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hahaha I ask chase and it was mav attacking felton
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Asked
Amanda  ----->  Ttar?? Dragon??
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I wondered about that too @Amanda 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Gyarados isn't dragon either...
Sam Kawell  ----->  He might have been saying that they all kind of look like dragons
Amanda  ----->  Gyarados?? Dragon??
Amanda  ----->  I type sooooo slow....
Sam Kawell  ----->  *slowly
Amanda  ----->   Slowly and incorrectly 😁🤷🏻‍♀️
Amanda  ----->  You received the irl eye roll that is normally reserved for Adam. Lol
Amanda  ----->  Red pen carriers...
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'll take that as a compliment
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  All 3 if mine got kicked out of felton 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If I didn't say this last week. I will not raid with Jimmy account anymore.
Darren May  ----->  Registeel 
Darren May  ----->  Good god almost an entire month 
Ian Fraser  ----->  That f5ing paying off.
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea you might want to make another spreadsheet...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Great. I prob won't have time today
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But its going to be exact same thing as regice, except easier
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No smack ttar
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Molt and flareon sun. Cloudy champ. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  And double ground Groudon for a tank
Sam Kawell  ----->  As soon as Darren posted a beldum spawned. Coincidence?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dont do tanks in GO. I delete revives like crazy. But if it's too squishy to get off more than 1 charge move, its prob not useable bc of rejoin time
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Champ is a nice balance of DPS and dont care if I wipe
Sam Kawell  ----->  Is it sad that I'm more excited about alolan Marowak than registeel?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not really. It seems pretty normal
Ian Fraser  ----->  Though my Machamps are gonna cry and all the Garvedoirs that will be filling gyms up. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  *at all
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not really. Lvl 40 champ still does  good enough brute force even if its C/DG gard. I power thru them easily
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean that’s true Machamp basically powers through everything lol. It’s still more annoying than them being as rare as they are now. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive still not come across a gym I cant mash the screen and win with 6 lvl 40 champ. Yes, a doge here and there so I don't die of boredom, but I prob don't need it. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Fair enough. Was trying to dodge usually in the past cause I was revive poor before gifts. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Now I guess it’s not as big a deal. Sitting on 80 revives and and as many Maxs
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I still delete max... Actually almost all my max
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I deleted 100 the other day in two separate instances. I think I just need go with only max for a while
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I must remind you you are not normal
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Back over 300 again
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hey! Im close to normal!?..... Right?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  ... Right?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Eh, not really. I think most people don't have to mass evolve max revives constantly...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I only use them for short maning a raid. Which almost never happens.... So I delete
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I try to use them. I did gym bully all summer. Never even got close to going down low on anyt battle items
Ian Fraser  ----->  Is Keaton the typical PoGo player? Let’s go to the boards, people. As you can see based on KarKar’s walking distance, the answer is: not really. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I vote. Typical! 1 to 1 tie
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Close the poles!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Lol we can do this formally.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Created new poll 'Is Keaton a typical PoGo player': https://s.groupme.com/pBDaIMYX
Ian Fraser  ----->  But you just have been sitting on a not terrible stick of revives when they cut down the drop rate. I don’t exactly not spin stops during the school year and I was constantly poor. Not as bad as the Pharma people though lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I loved it when that nerf came. I was still deleting like a mad man. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is when I wanted to drop bundles of 10 max revives on pharm building and watch them fight over them irl
GroupMe  ----->  Keaton Rhea added Blaine, E to the group.
GroupMe  ----->  Blaine, E has left the group.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dang I try to cheat.. .
GroupMe  ----->  Blaine, E has rejoined the group
Blaine, E  ----->  Kick me Keaton 
GroupMe  ----->  Keaton Rhea removed Blaine, E from the group.
GORT  ----->  Keaton Rhea: removing users is not allowed! (warning #1)

GroupMe  ----->  David Busby added Blaine, E to the group.
GroupMe  ----->  Blaine, E has left the group.
David Busby  ----->  Lol I just say leave her with the option of rejoining 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok sorry. I was trying to cheat vote. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I couldnt kick right away. Sorry everyone
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Princesses is sorry!
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m definitely confused lol 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I messed up as usual bc group me is what it is. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well not what I what I want it to be
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nah I was just confused why she wanted you to kick her rather than just leaving lol 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was cheating system. She can stay but we had no vote
Ian Fraser  ----->  I thought it was basically a “we’re all smart enough to know who should be added and who not to” system 😂
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea seems pretty normal...I trash a crazy amount of max potions.  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I trash all max potions!  I don’t have a single Pokémon that needs one! I’m slowly powering up my best blissey though. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive deleted 200+ max in past week alone.....
Cindy R  ----->  Wow, looks like they may be more common for you than me..I have done just over 100 this week. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Cindy R I don't think most people would call you or Daniel normal either. Just saying
Cindy R  ----->  LOL
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I discovered a conspiracy today. I think @Keaton Rhea has been secretly recruiting mystic. I bet there was 50 plus mystic today. 1 in 10 I knew or at least had seen before.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I honestly didn't know very many either. Tons of causal players have started back with the new trading/friend system I guess
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It does happen....
Darren May  ----->  Kirlia raid popped at Davis right as I got to work. 20 easy candies and I don’t have to worry about raiding for the rest of the day. Casual success
Darren May  ----->  No one volunteer to help Taylor yet. I may need someone to do zapdos for me. 😂 Or be willing to raid with me later in the 3 hr window
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Amanda I think you need to post that every couple of hours or so. Simplest, easiest to understand explanation I’ve seen 😁
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Should we share in mystic group as well?
David Busby  ----->  Probably about to add itsbearyo at Parker
David Busby  ----->  Should I add this new level 39?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So I just did a registeel raid up in Madison with 16 people and most everyone was either using Aggron or Tyranitar... I saw some Kyogre or Vaporeon, but literally no fire or fighting types
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Auto select doesnt pick the dank stuff. Show them the chart. Or maybe I need to make one with aggron and other bad things
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'll wait until I'm a little more known around here until I start talking strategy. I don't want to come off as pretentious.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It just shows the level of keeping us casuals informed you all provide. And I did look to see if I had a second DB gyrodos but ☹
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I'm guessing that's not something people were keeping, but I thought I might ask.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm assuming battles won per pokemon  only goes back so far and not to the beginning?
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think it actually goes back to the beginning. Bc I remember seeing Lee's Dragonites were at multiple thousand battles won right after the gym rework
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell On tsr one time they had handouts you could print out to give to people about dps and why aggron/blissey are bad
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  The only way yo know that stat is put it in a gym and have someone battle it to tell...is that right?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, unfortunately. It would be so easy to put it at the bottom of the Pokemon screen where the kms walked is.
Sam Kawell  ----->  And @Darren May dps evangelism sounds amazing.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Honestly I’d say go for it. Be the voice crying in the desert. Most of them won’t listen anyway. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Saving these in chat so they’re easier to find when we inevitable have to discuss having to add them. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Sam Kawell You need an info like the one Parker posted in big chat. They won’t respond to number 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This one? Haha
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser the persistence of those people are amazing
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm not sure if it's a mile stone for anyone else since I'm always behind on rare candy and stardust but about to finish my 60th level 40 pokemon.
Cindy R  ----->  Wonder if the zaps will come down easy.  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Wow Daniel!  I have 12 😂
Cindy R  ----->  I dont remember them being a pain in the butt..
David Busby  ----->  Pretty easy trio with smackdown ttars in the upper 30s I think
Cindy R  ----->  That's what we were wondering...hoping our 3 can do it.  There is one gym out near where we will be tomorrow. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby you mentioned a hard core group doing it tomorrow, but does anyone know of a general mystic group doing Zapdos? 
David Busby  ----->  Not that I’m aware of. I’ll be with Adam, Amanda, lee and several others. If you wanna jump in with us that’d be fantastic
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I'll only have around 15 passes, but I'd love to join for the first half
Sam Kawell  ----->  Just let me know where you're starting and I'll be there at 1
Cindy R  ----->  Wish we were gonna be there....we may try to slip into town for the last hour. 
David Busby  ----->  Be at large tractor wing ready to start lobby at one. Park in overflow if your wanting to take your own car 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Roger
David Busby  ----->  Will your brother be with you?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Nope. I'm going solo this time.
GroupMe  ----->  Poll 'Is Keaton a typical PoGo player' is about to expire
GroupMe  ----->  Poll 'Is Keaton a typical PoGo player' has expired
Keaton Rhea  ----->  KarKar OP
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I wish I could join you guys. I’ll be there in spirit 😁
Darren May  ----->  Was there a @Keaton Rhea spreadsheet for zapdos? For us poor souls short on smackdown ttars
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I did not make one. 28 and  35.5 no weather boost. 29.5 and 35.5 off top of head... Don't quote me on those. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  Looks I’ll be trading snookems some golems 
Darren May  ----->  Still salty about missing that community day
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry Darren!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If no ttar, golem is best bet @Darren May its a tier 4 so easy 4 man for most players in mid 30s
Keaton Rhea  ----->  5 is very safe
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But eitb aggron, go with like 6 or 7 haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May just for you
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I put aggron in there for fun
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I would only use ttar, rayray, or golem
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dnite aint bad either
Darren May  ----->  Ooo didn’t think about rayquaza 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Pretty good! I made a few corrections though. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rayray is a safe bet even with diailga and palikia coming. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Ian Fraser got it right
Sam Kawell  ----->  I do have one suggestion for you to change on your chart @Keaton Rhea . Your chart implies that Aggron is the 7th best Zapdos counter, which is probably why Ian got confused. You should change that number to 384 pls
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I could do that; however, in not sharing that outside of this group haha
Ian Fraser  ----->  Not confused I just have seen the light of our lord and savior the mighty Aggron! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  But for real I’m so tired of seeing those in raid battles 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I did two raids today with 6+ Aggrons and some people going in with multiple. It was sad
Darren May  ----->  Wait what? I was about to power up my 💯 aggron
Darren May  ----->  So rock blast is no good on golem?
David Busby  ----->  Three bar kinda suck in raids 
David Busby  ----->  Really two bar suck too there are just several insanely good moves
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rock blast is better if your using a lvl 20 golem tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You get one off, maybe 2 b4 you get hit hard. With zap, prob more
Darren May  ----->  Actually I might not use golems at this point. 2 30ish smackdown ttars plus my 37.5 Ray Ray then lvl 40 dnites I think
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes thats the way to go. Well... Unless it's all aggron
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Way past my bed time.
Phil Pearson  ----->  Guys I did 35
Phil Pearson  ----->  35 zapdos 
Phil Pearson  ----->  Also for remote gyms, if no one interacts with them you’ll get extra time on the raid
Sam Kawell  ----->  How many shiny @Phil Pearson ?
Phil Pearson  ----->  They look annoyingly similar to the regular 
Phil Pearson  ----->  So you’ve got to pay attention 
Darren May  ----->  What’s the typical battery life on the go plus? Couldn’t get mine to connect this morning 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive had mine since dec and replaced battrries once
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  When the battery is low it will give you a little battery icon on the game. I’ve replaced my battery twice since December but once was because I was having connection issues and wanted to see if that would help. 
Darren May  ----->  Update: was just a connection issue. Worked for zapdos mania
David Busby  ----->  West wants to add black sun. I told him no. Spams chats way too much
Amanda  ----->  Wickyticky asked me to. 
David Busby  ----->  He must be spamming the folks in opelika 
Cindy R  ----->  Them seem nice enough when we met them, but they chat soooooooo much! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Agreed. In all for giving anyone a chance, and im sure they will get one. However, id rather not have our chat turn into a dumpster ground bc they scare away the few active low lvls we have
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive been trying to meet them and gift them so they stick around. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, this jarel guy a mystic? He been hitting it hard
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Was lvl 27 what feels like a few days ago
David Busby  ----->  Yea he’s a nice guy he’s already been added tonmystic chat 
David Busby  ----->  Part of my problem with the black suns is I feel like they’re gonna bring drama 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. I dont got time for that. Kento add went well. Ppl knew him. Black suns grt similar negative comments to who knows them, but none of the low lvls know them at all
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think they deserve a shot if they can tone it down. My only concern is its gonna have to be me (a person they never met) to do intro and ask them to tone it down
Ian Fraser  ----->  I say we have our queen do it lol. But also I’ll say that I am far more opposed to adding them than I was to adding Kento. 
David Busby  ----->  Way more opposed as well. Kentoo would just be like whatever but he never seemed to draw the drama 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We've met them. Maybe making it clear the chat is not for talking to each other. Oddly seems he is more dramatic than her.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea that’s been my impression too 
Darren May  ----->  They are pretty annoying but usually mystic chat is more subdued than big chat. I’m for giving people a chance as long as we give them clear rules when they’re added (eg no spamming the chat). If they can’t follow the rules just kick them
David Busby  ----->  Have y’all seen what they post in opelika chat?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Negative. Other than brads posts and they piss me off
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Screen caps that is
David Busby  ----->  I mean that’s more than enough for a no from me 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But maybe they keep it there and lol pokes kento land
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im not a hard no. Juat a frown face but ill deal
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ofcouses that's the most Opelika chat has ever been used lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I sau avoid question best you can
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Say avoid
David Busby  ----->  Well obviously he’s trying to push it by asking people in mystic chat. I’m just gonna be annoyed if he asks someone that just adds him like Debbie 
Cindy R  ----->  It's inevitable....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Give it a try... however; I say kick and kick hard + ban both if he is an annoyance. This is from some one with patience. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  One try in mystic for them
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There are tons of mystic I barley know that I would take a 7 day ban from chat to not kick. The suns will never be one
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’d say definitely don’t add them until we’ve figured out exactly what we’re gonna say as their intro “or else message”
Amanda  ----->  Anything we say they’re gonna jump and instantly become passive aggressive defensive 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ill not ne the one adding....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not be the one
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I can be bad cop
Cindy R  ----->  I dread anything to do with those 2.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also dont care about my rep. I can be the bully (just like gyms)
David Busby  ----->  How about when they actually make themselves known to one of us we pick up the issue again
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea cause your the gym bully..LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got respected ppl following me. Ill be an ugly (respectable) mouth if needed. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Once again. Avoid question!
Cindy R  ----->  Avoid any raids they are at..lol
David Busby  ----->  Already doing that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes that but help the plebs too. Spread word of mouth. Not chat bc they can scroll up uf they get in
Amanda  ----->  Just let everyone know only admins can add.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. But no one can add black suns... I mean...
Amanda  ----->  Exactly 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wanna talk but im awful in person. I need time to make words for intro. I write for a living. But not good writing. Just for publishing
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean for the most part people in mystic chat don’t just add anyone so we seem to have done an okay job of making than an unspoken rule. 
Cindy R  ----->  I think David made that clear with Taylor p the other day..lol
David Busby  ----->  I don’t even remember what I said lol
David Busby  ----->  Was it bad?
David Busby  ----->  Was it not while I’m group owner?
Cindy R  ----->  That was it...made me laugh. Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Taylor still things im Lee....
Cindy R  ----->  He is so...colorful!  Glad I dont have young children that play with us.  Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wouldn't even care. Im not a dad yet but I think they should be exposed
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They don't have to agree. Just experience it. Bc it's coming in real world
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I forgot the sun's use the Facebook page daily too.
Cindy R  ----->  Oh I dont have an issue with it...just wouldn't want to have to answer those questions. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Like mommy why's the man's nipples showing
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Manta cant answer that :/
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I can handle that question, I’ve gotten much harder ones from my two. They are too damn smart. I haven’t met the  couple in question but he does really annoy me in chat. I’d rather not have them in mystic chat. Y’all just have to tell me what to say to them if they ever ask me; I’m terrible when put on the spot. 
Amanda  ----->  Just say 😮there’s a Mystic group????😮 I didn’t even know😮
Amanda  ----->  Ya’ll should start one! 
Amanda  ----->  Then we can send all the casuals their way. 
Amanda  ----->  Problem solved
David Busby  ----->  Oh i mean I kinda made a group for that. It’s just currently occupied by brad, mojo, Garrett, and Rachel 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It is kind of my fault that Taylor P got added. 🤦‍♀️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol no. I can be the butt if needed. They dont know me. Ill ignore for days
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I smoke butt, I guess I can be a real butt lol
Amanda  ----->  I like Taylor p now. Before. No
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes he is good. So is kento. Every one deserves a chance... With one strike
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Taylor has grown on me. He’s definitely entertaining. I just know that some people didn’t want him added. 
David Busby  ----->  I was worried Taylor p would go back to slave ball bitch and stuff. He claims the first time he ever did a legendary was latios with me and that is not the case. He did 1865 and Felton with us the week of one of the georgia games 
David Busby  ----->  Back when he repped the “gay as fuck” shirt
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I remember that Latios raid at Dillard bc it was the first time I met Taylor. He keeps reminding me that it was his first legendary 😜
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea did today's raids put you ahead of me?
David Busby  ----->  So you know how @Amanda liked my posts then unliked? Black sun is currently doing that to me. He doesn’t even know me
Amanda  ----->  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Amanda  ----->  Happy Birthday @Daniel R 🎉 
David Busby  ----->  Happy birthday man!
Phil Pearson  ----->  Happy birthday!
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Daniel R 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Happy Birthday @Daniel R!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry a little late, but happy birthday @Daniel R 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R not yet
Cindy R  ----->  So close!!! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m catching up to you @Keaton Rhea!  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @David Busby The black Sun is just trying to get in good with the queen so he can be in mystic chat. I’m so sad that I actually went to bed last night and missed out on giving you a hard time 😉
Cindy R  ----->  Same here @Elizabeth Kidd Yost lol
David Busby  ----->  Do we know if Leslie has physically ever tried to solo any tier threes?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I know she called out for help before when she failed a champ
Keaton Rhea  ----->  At library
Darren May  ----->  Hey oh! @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nice!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've got two more. More on the way tomorrow!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've got two now*
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I like “collecting” gym badges when we travel. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  All the casuals are gonna be level 33+ as soon as they start hitting bff with people. 🤔
David Busby  ----->  Tempted to raise level cap for entry into mystic 
David Busby  ----->  Some rando that dmed me finally ran into me at a raid and asked to get into mystic chat. Black sun was standing right there while I explained you need to be level 30 and involved in the community
David Busby  ----->  Oh also black sun had no idea who I was
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m almost inclined to agree. Though I will say if someone is maintaining their friendship for 90 days to reach the ridiculous amount of empty xp bff brings they’re probably active enough to be in Mystic anyway. 
David Busby  ----->  Or have an alt and multiple devices
Ian Fraser  ----->  God help us when Kento gets the bffs with all his alts and still thinks empty xp is a myth. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Was the rando sub 30? 
David Busby  ----->  He’s got 4 level 40 accounts and well still count him as one 😂
David Busby  ----->  Oh yea
David Busby  ----->  But he was just level 28 the other day and he’s already 29!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sigh. Niantic really has really devalued levels and there nothing we can really do about it. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Was it someone who’s active raiding in big chat? If so I’d say usually just tell him to dm you when he hits 30 and call it a day. In the end we can’t make someone actually be good at raiding before we add them just because of all the empty xp. 
David Busby  ----->  I told him usually you get added when we see you doing work. Never met him before today or really seen him post in chat 
David Busby  ----->  Honko or something 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh yea. Wasn’t paying much attention, but I think he’s brand new cause I’ve never seen his name until today. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hype
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What's that lucky egg for in the back ground lol....just a little empty exp...lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive got 4 ultra friends now
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser could you explain the nickname?
Ian Fraser  ----->  He’s blue @Sam Kawell 
Ian Fraser  ----->  https://youtu.be/68ugkg9RePc
Sam Kawell  ----->  I knew it was some culture reference I missed
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Lol something's you just can't unsee after you click on it.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea I’m not sure how weird that video might be or not, i copied the first link I found. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  It is definitely... Interesting....
Sam Kawell  ----->  But there is a lot of blue
Keaton Rhea  ----->  A lot of blue in my top friends list now. And pete is just kinda chillin there haha
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, my top 10 are all mystic
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im kings all over with jin, pete, adam and Garrett as top non mystic
Sam Kawell  ----->  Actually now it's the top 13
David Busby  ----->  Damn y’all have been much better friends than me
David Busby  ----->  I should hit ultra with ross today and then Adam, keaton, and Elizabeth aren’t too far off
David Busby  ----->  Also is that snorlax perfect and is that what you said when you caught him?
David Busby  ----->  @Sam Kawell 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And just where is my name lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  When I appraised him, but yeah.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Daniel R It took a little work bc I wasn’t thinking clearly this morning but we were able to coordinate gift opening so we both had a lucky egg on. 😜
Matt Inger  ----->  BradyC6307 was spoofing in a couple of my raids this morning.  Just a heads up
David Busby  ----->  Where those raids even called out in chat?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I was noticing some instinct spoofers have returned Tallassee 
Matt Inger  ----->  The first one was called out, it was at Wells, and then he was in right after hatch with me at FP.  He was just a level 17, valor
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Just Incase you didn’t see in mystic chat, gifts from me this week are long distance. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And if your extra lucky, contain a vulpix!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Am I missing something or is the only way to organize your friends list am to add ! to the beginning of nicknames?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes that is pretty much it. You have to nickname them and filter by alphabetical
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So what is Gary walkers game name? Just in case I see him in gyms lol. Also what kind of gym interest do all these new mystic have? Everyone wants in the mystic chat but are they gym active or just want to raid? I was just curious. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Im not sure on his name. Is he the flamingGold one?
David Busby  ----->  He was goldenblaze but I think he changed name to flaminggold 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ah ok. I knocked him out of arb this morning then
David Busby  ----->  He’s so casual he thought one of the quests on research page for unknown was an actual unown. Oh and that everyone gets the same encounter ivs. Started going off about a perfect dratini. I was almost in my car 
David Busby  ----->  But it wasn’t even perfect 🙄
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  This is Gary Walker.  
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We'll have to say hellow. We left them something to do at the museum 
David Busby  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost What’s his battles won and pokes caught?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Battles: 573 Pokemon: 4388
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Stalkers lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  Fun fact: a raid group in Madison failed to beat a registeel with 7 people.. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wtf....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Can't lvl 20 champs beat it with 4 ot maybe 5?
David Busby  ----->  I’d say level 20 champs would take 5-6. That would also require them to be using c/dp and I bet some people just use machamp and use double steel
Ian Fraser  ----->  I caught Catie doing that in a gym sweep the other day. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I know from experience they just use recommended, which I guess for them is still aggrons
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Aggron OP. I deleted all of mine but one haha
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think they somehow caught Ian's modification of your chart
Sam Kawell  ----->  Update: four more people arrived just in time and they were able to beat it. Phew
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Halfway there!  Nothin like a little empty xp!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Some good ole empty exp mixed in with a bunch of evos
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea your mass evolves paid off...I am too lazy for those..LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So I was getting about 50 to 60 evo in with old phone. Can't wait to see what new one can do
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh you should get 80 easy. What phone did you get?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  S9+
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Stupid fast
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I had note 5
Sam Kawell  ----->  Dang. That'll will be fast
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've quick caught 3 mon so far. So much better
Cindy R  ----->  Poor Pete...we happened to do a raid in poka on the way home.  Can't make gold easy for him...Lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Who is bluemax?
Sam Kawell  ----->  I was just about to say that myself
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That person want added in the last 2 days as far as I can tell 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So I was curious so I scrolled back about 8 days and never say that person. Also group me will error close that far back. Also I took some screen shots as I went back. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Jazz @  kimmie and a few others and tonight I noticed they were talking about starting instinct accounts.....thoughts?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think bluemax is a guy from Columbus that Sabi added. He’s in Auburn for the week. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think Kimmie was talking about starting an instinct alt. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well in more optimistic thoughts, it's pretty awesome having a wife who is willing to trade Dratinis
Sam Kawell  ----->  And it's 93%
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You mean she caught something besides a sentret @Sam Kawell?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, since trading has come out I've convinced her to catch other things to trade for her furrets
Sam Kawell  ----->  *my furrets
Sam Kawell  ----->  She's up to 88 Furrets
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well this has been my night
Cindy R  ----->  @Sam Kawell what are you using to IV check your lucky mons? Pokegenie will not work on them.
David Busby  ----->  I’ve heard if you half the dust requirement manually it works. But I’ve also been casual af today
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I was just using pokeassistant website until calcy IV pushes out an update
Cindy R  ----->  Genie did update so it works...we have to manually doodle the stardust and it works.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May what was lathe quest? 3 great curve in row for 5 ultra? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I beat it too fast
Darren May  ----->  Hmm that is the stop I normally have to leave my office for. I’m casualling hard this week but I’ll try and check it out later
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok I can check with some one later if it's too much of a burden haha. I know you don't even want ultra
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Confirmed!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks Darren 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well that was a waste. Nothing on campus at all today
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just trash ultra back quests 
Amanda  ----->  🤩
David Busby  ----->  Is that number two?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I may have to unfriend her
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Why have you been in dadeville? Yes I stalk lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Amanda 
Amanda  ----->  Adam interviewed at Tru in Ashland, and we went up to Talladega then came down 280 home
Darren May  ----->  So what exactly is the lucky Pokémon strategy or is there one? What should I be trying to do?
Amanda  ----->  ^^^what Darren said^^^ we need answers
Darren May  ----->  I got a level 16 lucky dragonite from snookems. 10 attack 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  We just don't have enough data to say yet. There are likely different percentage ranges based on how many luckies you've gotten in a day and how old the poke is, but we won't know what those ranges are until the silph road has acquired a large sample of data. Tentative early theories say your early trades have the highest chance and your chance seems to decrease as you gain more luckies. Also, some say there is a limit to the amount of luckies you can get per day. But we just need more time and data for actual strategies
David Busby  ----->  Do we keep movesets? Cause I wouldn’t mind a half dust cost level 40 bodyslam snorlax
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think the real benefit for most of us will still be months away when we reach best friends and start trading all these low IV legends 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Or something lucky related to gene 4
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, movesets don't change
Sam Kawell  ----->  I just think it makes trading exciting again.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Cause look at this bad boy
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I've already deleted 4 or 5
Sam Kawell  ----->  I will be sad when I have to.
Sam Kawell  ----->  But I think it would be cool to have a living lucky dex
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Stop it....no more collecting lol
Darren May  ----->  So can 1 person in a trade get a lucky Pokémon and the other person not?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Nope. I think that happened some initially, but it was fixed quickly.
Darren May  ----->  So 1 person should trade an old random Pokémon while the other trades a high level, bad iv, meta relevant poke?
Cindy R  ----->  Just to throw a curveball....daniel and I got 8 lucky in one evening.  All we traded were random ones that were caught within the last few weeks.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah. It's still uncertain whether the chance is increased more by using two older pokes, but for getting good meta relevant pokes, that's the best strategy
Sam Kawell  ----->  Haha, it's stories like that that show we need time and lots of data to know the actual rates
Cindy R  ----->  We did have distance...gulf shores/mobile traded with local ones.
Matt Inger  ----->  All of mine have been lucky but all have included at least one that is old with distance.  
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Amanda you haven't opened my gift in days!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  She didn’t open mine for days either 😔
Amanda  ----->  😔I have missed over a week of gift opening all together
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I guess that makes me feel a little better
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Did you start your new job this week @Amanda ?
Darren May  ----->  Me and snookems did about 10 trades when luckies were first announced but before they were activated. Lost some really old stuff 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well that sucks.
Amanda  ----->  Yes, but it was even before that. Sometimes I accidentally fall asleep before opening by trying to wait to see who I’ve raided with, but I haven’t even been raiding...I’m just a horrible friend 😔 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I opened one from David last night so we could become ultra friends and I was so tired that I almost went to bed without opening anymore. 
Darren May  ----->  Downside of being a casual I guess. We had interviews all day so I saw the ingame notice when I was leaving work. Got home and started trading...Other problem is most of my older stuff was already high iv anyway (and usually an Eeveelution)
Darren May  ----->  @Amanda Same
Ian Fraser  ----->  Should I get a 3rd BS Snorlax (I’ve been causal this month) or wait 5 days for a extra Raikou? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I think Raikou. 🤔🤔
Darren May  ----->  I say raikou. I think I’m going to do that  too even though it will mess up all my streaks being on the same day. So painful 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lunt one lowder
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lunatone 
Sam Kawell  ----->  (unless you have a perfect Snorlax and pitifully few candies)
Sam Kawell  ----->  Going back to the Snorlax vs Raikou question
Ian Fraser  ----->  Don’t have perfect. And think I would prefer a perfect Raikou over Snorlax.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I might have been talking about someone else....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rai will b best electric until gen 5; however,  the only t5 bosses he will b good against are kyogre, Sui, tornados. Mystic keldeo and maphy if they change how those work
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mythic*
Ian Fraser  ----->  Dang it, if I had been one day less casual I could get another Lax and 5 Raikou. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Actually you have until 4 pm on the first of the month to get the previous month’s reward right? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think so
Ian Fraser  ----->  Cause the only way I can get another Lax and 5 Rai is by getting my last Rai on Sept 1st. Ah well.  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So if I get a raiku on August 1, I could get 5 raikous?
Ian Fraser  ----->  As long as you get a Raikou by August 3rd you can definitely get 5 Raikou. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Basically there are 5 Fridays in August. 
Darren May  ----->  Also you have to wait on the 1st until it switches over. I know a few people who messed up and got the previous reward poke
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes, you have to wait until 3pm. I made that mistake last month. 
David Busby  ----->  I’m not liking that
David Busby  ----->  That’s more kms than I have total 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Dang. This is my highest
Keaton Rhea  ----->  KarKar OP
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I waked a drat 450ish and a dnite 100 as well
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip didn't make my goal. Too ashamed to post.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  What was your goal @Keaton Rhea?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was going for some more exp but I didn't get time to collect bodies to evo
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is better. @Elizabeth Kidd Yost
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think I officially have no chance of beating you to 40! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Almost out of rat candies
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea one of these days I'll do a few evos.
Cindy R  ----->  Ok, you are the master...Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have less than 1k rat. Less than 2k sentret. 3.8k hop. 2k seed. 2k oddish. 1k paras, hoot and spinarak. 1.5k mail. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I could go on
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I started this with 3k rat and sentret. 8.5k pidgey
Keaton Rhea  ----->  3k weedle. 1k cater
Cindy R  ----->  Finally!
David Busby  ----->  Keaton when I go to take myself out of Sam Harris tomorrow please don’t berry lol 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dee was in it last night haha @David Busby 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I didn't feel like reading up in all the groups, but has anyone seen this? I know it's rumors, but it would be super cool if true
https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/92m57q/discussion_possible_gen_4_leak/?utm_source=reddit-android
Ian Fraser  ----->  That would be nice. I could finally evolve the gen3 stuff I’ve been sitting on!!
Sam Kawell  ----->  I would just love to see increased evolution spawns and to finally see wild salamemce and Metagross
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gimme gimme
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Today may be the first time I've every seen a Pokemon go commercial 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Everyone keeps taking about go commercials. I've yet to see one. Where did you see it Daniel? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also forgot to post pics of new dog hair cut here yesterday
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Not sure of the channel but thought it was odd. Last night watching irobot, then today watching Armageddon. So not like it was Nickelodeon or something along that line.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And it's specific about the trading
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok ill b looking for it. I don't watch  many channels. Mostly food network lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  https://v.groupme.com/39263023/2018-07-29T20:10:23Z/43a5250a.640x360r.mp4
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Keaton Rhea got it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Question: what would be a good way to determine if someone spoofed for a kangashkan if you doubt their honesty
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looking at the location and date? Did they claim to get in Australia? 
David Busby  ----->  @Ian Fraser You gonna get that eevee?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Which Eevee? 
David Busby  ----->  Check big group
David Busby  ----->  Hundo near stadium deck
Ian Fraser  ----->  What side is it on? 
David Busby  ----->  Just asked him
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, he says he visited Australia in January 2017
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Idk
David Busby  ----->  So I was just thinking if older pokes are more likely to be lucky then wouldn’t that mean shadow claw gengar would be highly likely to be lucky 😳😍
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would say if you really need to know and your comfortable asking, then make him share his plane ticket receipt 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I only have 3 SC gengar :/
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mmm meatballs
Ian Fraser  ----->  It’s occurred to me because of Black Sun being super proud of putting a Ttar as a defender in a gym? Is a Smack Down Ttar a good defender? If I recall the biggest reason Ttar was so terrible on defense was because Bite was far faster on attack than on the auto-timed defense. Does smack down change that since it’s a slower move anyway? Can our resident number people weigh in @Sam Kawell @Keaton Rhea 
David Busby  ----->  Ttar is a terrible defender it’s double weak to fighting
Sam Kawell  ----->  What David said. It's really not a DPS problem, just a survivability problem
Darren May  ----->  Hey @David Busby taking all the credit for turning auburn blue when we always have campus on lockdown (during the semester anyway). 😂
David Busby  ----->  Ok fair enough we did all the off campus work 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I remember that day. I wanted to help but I was stuck volunteering at my kid’s school. 
David Busby  ----->  I just remember Levi getting all excited and checking gymhuntr for us 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was working at the book fair and there was no one shopping so I was reading GroupMe but I couldn’t leave. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Just got a rare one for the collection
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @David Busby I remember that day well. Adrenaline rush when you and Amanda were going for St Michael’s and Goal Post
David Busby  ----->  The best part was people just continuing to call out spots. And then it just snowballed. I remember racing to fucking st michaels
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wait, this was the full one
David Busby  ----->  Saved
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  You’re gonna get a lot of people asking what that site is
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, GroupMe doesn't let you scroll that far back, but I totally saved those. February 8th
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Those were the days...when I was jobless and free...
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  And the storm and valor both tucked their tails and hid in terror
David Busby  ----->  F to fun Taylor and scanners
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  FF
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby thats the most passive aggressive nickname ever
Keaton Rhea  ----->  When you about to go Manta bot and you run into your advisor waking out the door
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess worse things could of happened..... 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May and @Elizabeth Kidd Yost I don't know if you were planning on chaining ultra friends tomorrow, but if you don't, I'd appreciate you guys sending me a gift tonight or early tomorrow so I can do both you guys and my brother on a lucky egg. If not, it's no problem
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve already sent you one today but I’ll try to send you another one first thing in the morning.
Darren May  ----->  What are friends for, amirite?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Thanks guys. I also appreciate all the gifts you send, cause I normally only get around 5 gifts per day
Sam Kawell  ----->  To send that is
David Busby  ----->  Oh dang. I’ll send more gifts 
David Busby  ----->  You usually at least have twenty to open?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Same, I’ll send more 
Cindy R  ----->  I try to hit you guys every day if the last one is open..Sam we are not as good of friends yet.  I will try to make sure I hit you regularly. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I know I'm down on most of y'all's lists, but I just don't have that many stops to spin. I get 4 on my way to work and then there is one stop and one gym that I go to a couple times during the day, but it's quite a culture shock from auburn where I saw 10 gyms and innumerable pokestops from my office.
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May I'll be opening your gift in 5 minutes
Darren May  ----->  Go for it. I’m out of lucky eggs so I’m considering buying one if I ever have the chance to get a few friendship boosts at the same time
Darren May  ----->  We will really have to coordinate to maximize that empty xp for the best friends bonus. Do we know how much xp it is?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ultra is 50k with no lucky
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What is everyone's ultra friend list look like? I'm at 18 and will get 3 more in the next 2-3 days
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Best is 100k
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve got 13. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I only have one so far lol. Should get five in 8 days. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Dang, j thought I was good with 5. But I'm getting 5 more in 8 days
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have 78 friends and try to send a gift to almost everyone that can accept one on M-F. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  You're so popular
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'd say like 10 of those are casuals from other teams and have not opened my gift since getting great
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess Manta is a house hold name now? 
Darren May  ----->  6 with 5 more in the next couple of days. I’m a terrible friend though. There are plenty of hardcore players I’m too lazy to add. Basically I treat the friend system like Facebook. If people want to be my friend they can add me. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My friend list is my Facebook I guess. I don't use it at all
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't even know by Facebook pw. I tried to reset it and i failed. Most of them were who is this person, and I've not seen them in like 10 yrs so I'll just let it sit. 
Darren May  ----->  I primarily use Facebook to feel superior to people from my hometown. I don’t need it to feel superior but it helps
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have the phone numbers of the few ppl I want to talk to from back when I used it in high school. Yeah all like 6 of them
Sam Kawell  ----->  Question: do you think Robert was being facetious with his comment about an incense or is he just very confused.
Ian Fraser  ----->  I THINK he was being facetious...but I’m not honestly sure 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I really just don't know at this point
David Busby  ----->  @Darren May I promise your still a better friend than @Amanda at least you open my gifts
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Don't want to here it lol.
David Busby  ----->  Dang I only have 11 ultra 
Amanda  ----->  Ya’ll are all in my top 15 when I search by level!!!!!! I swear I can be a better friend!!!!
Amanda  ----->  Proof of how much I have been playing! I’ll be uncasual soon.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm having a hard time with gifts. I've being piping my over seas friends trying to get that going 
Amanda  ----->  3 of those were the first day it was out 😱
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If only we had an Australia friend???
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sadly i have 3 Australia friends. With no return lol 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t know about Robert’s comment but zacharaptor dmd me this morning to coordinate gift opening today when we become ultra friends. He’d already opened a gift from me today and didn’t realize that friendship levels only increase once per day. 
Darren May  ----->  Hmm should I buy a lucky egg for 3 ultra friends?
Ian Fraser  ----->  One one hand yes. On the other hand you’re 40 soooo
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yas
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Empty exp it up
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ain't no shame if you're already 40
Darren May  ----->  One one hand I’d like to stop worrying about xp altogether. I have a lot of mass evolve fodder I want to just transfer but I know they will up the level cap as soon as I do.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I did like 15 mass evo in the past week in a half. I'm just going to collect candy for now
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I'm just collecting candy and transferring the trash If they ever do raise the cap, I'll at least have a bunch of candies for the mass evolutions and I'll only have to catch the pokes.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Cause I think the only way I'll ever get the motivation to do mass evolutions again is if they raise the cap
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That's seems to be why we keep pushing to 40 x 2 just in case. Of course our luck it won't count towards it.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've kinda been doing that in cycles.  Once I get 3.5k rat and sentret candies I'll do a few mass evo. Pidey is unlimited for me. I'm back over 7k
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I need to do pidey only mass evo to balance it out but I'm lazy
Darren May  ----->  Also that was my (semi) casual friend who posted the 98 raikou in big group and didn’t know how to check the ivs. Same guy who hatched a shiny magby and caught a shiny swablu in less than 10 encounters. 🤦‍♂️ 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't think I'm going to like that post
David Busby  ----->  Jonahdabinator?
David Busby  ----->  He loops the museum a lot or at least used to 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R @Daniel R @Elizabeth Kidd Yost do not open my gifts. I opened yours just now
Darren May  ----->  Yeah he is the preacher at auburn Church of Christ so he can see the museum from the church office.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby i have no idea who that is but I don't play museum much
David Busby  ----->  That’s Matt dabbs the dude who got the good raikou. Didn’t know he was a preacher guess I’ll try to watch my mouth lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have one last gift from Orlando. If anyone wants it let me know...first come first serve!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just catching up on chat. I almost feel bad that i think that's just funny. At least they didn't drive to Columbus lol.
David Busby  ----->  @Daniel R Did you open the gift I sent you today or should I open yours?
Darren May  ----->  @Daniel R On one hand I don’t support hardcore trolling of the casuals but those were some pretty out there unown instructions where you think common sense would kick in
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also...a casual started the trolling this time around. Black Sun was the first one to mention an unknown there last night. 
Darren May  ----->  @Ian Fraser Did you like your own message as an homage to Black Sun?
Ian Fraser  ----->  I think I misclicked liking your message cause group me does weird things. 

Or I could just think that I’m old and wise. Who knows..
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Michelle U @Cindy R i guess we are double friends today
Sam Kawell  ----->  I just had issues with the list as well. I sorted by friendship and you and one of my brother's (who is giving me a tropius) had disappeared.
Sam Kawell  ----->  But you're all back after a restart.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mine didn't work until I restated my phone. Restarting app didn't fix it
GroupMe  ----->  Blaine, E has rejoined the group
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Let's see that lucky ttar @Blaine, E 
Blaine, E  ----->  ...how did I rejoin? �
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Let's see it
Sam Kawell  ----->  It seems like GroupMe just wants you in hede
Sam Kawell  ----->  *here
Blaine, E  ----->  Seems like someone had me rejoin when they had my phone 😅 
GroupMe  ----->  Keaton Rhea added Joseph Spalding to the group.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And yes that was from a raid. Was like 2063CP
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wow. Lowest lucky possible...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ermagherd. So many secret socities!
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Joseph Spalding tell no one
Sam Kawell  ----->  Or you will disappear
Joseph Spalding  ----->  So glad I get to use this again today. 😂
Joseph Spalding  ----->  But I take it to da grave! No leaks from me. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm in more grewp me's than I would like to admit. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Amen
Cindy R  ----->  Do you guys have a secret secret society...LOL. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Maybe... Maybe not
Cindy R  ----->  I cant handle the few I am in....couldn't imagine more. LOL
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Double secret or secret squared?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can not comment on it
Ian Fraser  ----->  It’s secrets all the way down 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I has the TSCI AND THE NEED TO KNOW!!! Tell me now!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Here is the most secret group im in. It's so confidential no one can even post in it.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @David Busby we can do baughman. I wasn't sure if you were coming because we were asking or if there was already a group. Just let us know.
David Busby  ----->  I’m here now 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  One burrito and a jelly dog 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was wondering why Joe wasn’t in here! Welcome!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was too. Sorry Joe :/
David Busby  ----->  Y’all do know I now have no reason to ever post in mystic really lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You’ve hardly posted in mystic for months. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Tell him off Elizabeth! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I mean I haven’t posted that much in mystic lately either. I am summer casual though.  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Guess what?  School starts next week 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So not ready for fall sem plebs. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R you got a gift? I'm trying to get you ultra lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just a sec lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll open it so you don't have to
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thank you Daniel :) 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sorry I usually do gifti by when I get home.....just got home lol. We were spinning our few little tallassee stops for the new thing lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No worries. I just wantwd to make sure I got you before I went to bed 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes judge all you want
Cindy R  ----->  Lol. Slightly judging 8:30 bedtime...lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Judge away. Not like I'm laying in bed about to turn off phone............................ 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It's ok. Cindy's dad goes to bed about now.........hes 70 plus but....lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  How do you not know I'm 70+?
Darren May  ----->  Ttar just hatched at wilmore. Anyone interested? I’m afraid to post in mystic or big group and get the ken2 squad
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Want to duo @Darren May ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry just now saw it
Darren May  ----->  I’ll try it. Don’t know if my champs are good enough 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  How many lvl 40 and how many 30?
Darren May  ----->  Uh not sure atm. Pokebattler says it’s possible and I know I have some champs I haven’t added there
Darren May  ----->  2 40s and 6 in there 30s. I’m here if you want to try it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok I omw
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If anyone was wondering, we beat that poor ttar with ~40 sec left
Darren May  ----->   Very anticlimactic. Nowhere near as fun as when we trioed the outrage latios.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes, but that was dragon claw tho? 
Darren May  ----->  I think so. It was whatever the hardest moveset was and it took a couple of tries
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And that was way more stressful bc we failed the first time and only had one more chance b4 timer expried
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I only had 2 rays powered up then too. I've got 4 now so it would be easy peasy
Darren May  ----->  Yeah I remember having to tweak my bteam order to make it work. But that was Level 39 Darren
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Now it's OP Darren 
Darren May  ----->  Casual except for Mewtwo Darren
Darren May  ----->  @Daniel R Are you watching Felton/doing the ex raid today? There were some casuals attacking but I have to go back to work 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Is Felton still blue? If it’s blue w/the Mewtwo we need a screenshot of that. 
Cindy R  ----->  Hey @Darren May sorry just seeing this...we didnt realize there was one today just happened to drop...will go check it 
Cindy R  ----->  What time is the ex raid?
Darren May  ----->  1:30
Cindy R  ----->  Surprised no egg on it yet.  I can watch for another 10 mins then go back to work.
Darren May  ----->  I’ve been watching but it will be tough once I leave work and go to pick up snookems 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Gengar is a pretty good defender....
Cindy R  ----->  Daniel is gonna try to watch it. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Who put the gengar in? 
Blaine, E  ----->  ...me
Sam Kawell  ----->  Lol, well he might scare people away because he's so spooky
Cindy R  ----->  Someone is nibbling....
Cindy R  ----->  @Darren May 
Sam Kawell  ----->  In your defense Blaine, I'm more of a fan of Gengar as a defender than slaking
Sam Kawell  ----->  *emily
David Busby  ----->  Do I need to show up to Felton and berry?
Matt Inger  ----->  I’m at Felton and can provide support 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm berrying from cindyies at the moment 
Blaine, E  ----->  *Blaine is preferred. Also I knew I would be judged! All the goog defenders I had were already in the gym...
Cindy R  ----->  Daniel is trying to watch from both our accts... good luck guys!
Darren May  ----->  Ok I’ll be there in about 20 minutes but no berries from me until then
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And yes. Should post in the mystic group for others to show up and help.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Also there's no egg on the gym yet
David Busby  ----->  If you don’t have pass you won’t see the egg 
Cindy R  ----->  Oh yea!!!  I forgot that 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So sad 😭
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Someone else just berried
Matt Inger  ----->  I’m here.  Lucky I got my wife’s login so she’s got plenty of goldens 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'll keep both phones open if you need me to razz just @ me
Sam Kawell  ----->  Who's fighting it @Matt Inger ?
Matt Inger  ----->  Who knows, lots of people here already 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  For historical purposes 
Cindy R  ----->  So sad it was blue for the one we didnt do the raid for....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :(
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks for keeping it blue for us tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I forgot to mention, but I might of used some of slimjin's golden razz to keep the gym blue haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I leave for Europe tomorrow night. All my gifts after will b from Stockholm, Bern, or Zurich. I'll try to play and send gifts but I'm going casual for most part. 
David Busby  ----->  F that my ultra frand needs to bring back mimes and volbeat
David Busby  ----->  Zurich is awesome just btw 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll try my best! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Limited data and I'll b the only one that plays haha
David Busby  ----->  Looks like I’ll be sending manta my account and money for data 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol already got the pre paid plan set up. But its more of a time issue 
David Busby  ----->  Going for business or pleasure?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  With my family. They were gracious enough to bring Carroll and I along. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You think some grad student going anywhere good? 
David Busby  ----->  Hope you enjoy it! Switzerland is awesome and has great food. I didn’t know if you got lucky for some conference
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol no. My advisor is going to Hawaii next week. I wrote the paper and the presentation... I was not invited
Michelle U  ----->  Just use hotel Wi-Fi and catch tons of trash to trade!
Blaine, E  ----->  @David Busby I have a Mr. Mime if you still needed one
Blaine, E  ----->  Although we are not on the same friend level yet 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes @Michelle U that is the goal. But making space is hard.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Keep in mind I'm a hoarder
Michelle U  ----->  I will gladly take some ttars to help you clear up space 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've not transferred a single one since I started (not counting re roll for trades) 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ll take that mr mime off yer handz @Blaine, E 
Blaine, E  ----->  Come get your flu shot from me and we have a deal@Joseph Spalding 
Blaine, E  ----->  � but I do have 2 if you legit want one!
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I can help with bag space problems 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ill hit you up when we get back from Disney @Blaine, E 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm sure you can @David Busby ... But hoarder mind I had to get off of 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Joseph Spalding dont let her stab you! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ll volunteer my wife as tribute to the flu shot gods before I’ll let that happen @Keaton Rhea 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Good deal. Carroll for the sacrifice 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  As well
Blaine, E  ----->  What kind of confidence are you instilling in us future health care professionals 🤔
Yours probably won't hurt @Joseph Spalding , cant promise the same for @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip me
Joseph Spalding  ----->  “Probably”
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ded
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Blaine, E Do you do Healthy Tiger Assessments?
Blaine, E  ----->  Not at the AUPCC on campus, but I have shadowed them doing the wellness checkups and gave shots at the flu clinic they had. But also I work at Publix pharmacy so that is what I was referring to! �
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That didn’t post right. These are our new skitties that we picked up after mewtwo today 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Blaine, E Do you remember who all was in the raid with us today?  This is all I could remember. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Super cute kitty pics!!! 
Blaine, E  ----->  Emilypickle was not, ashofwinter and krutipatuti were. I'm trying to remember any others, but it was a lobby of 17 🙈 @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I know! I’m sure I had 10 flash up for friendship level increases but It goes away so fast I can’t ever see everybody. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Boo yah!
David Busby  ----->  Ok which hsv spoofer gave you that
Sam Kawell  ----->  Now now, my brother actually went to Israel for a class
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm super reluctant to trade for regionals up here, tho
David Busby  ----->  Ok if it’s your brother I’ll give you that. I can be salty tho. Still don’t even think I have the seen for that
Ian Fraser  ----->  Hmmm I’m gonna have to get my Jewish friend to start playing again when he takes his trip to Israel...
Sam Kawell  ----->  I relish your salt
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also @Joseph Spalding I totally accidentally became ultra friends with you without warning you. I didn't realize it was happening today...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I didn’t realize we were that close until the notification popped up, and then I was like 💩, that just happened. lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I’m supposed to let you know that Catie got a shiny bulba from a research encounter yesterday. Casual luck coming in clutch. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't even have a shiny bulb :/
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea ! Do I need to give you a shiny bulb???
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ill take one off yer hands. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean I’ve got two...And Carie does now as well. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Just traded this to my brother and hp atk, and def were all the highest. And it was 13-13-13....
Cindy R  ----->  @Joseph Spalding we can meet up one night next week.  
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ill be in orlando all week next week
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Any time after that is great 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R i was hoping to get one from Emily after best friends 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Question about research. On the power up 5x task for charmander, squirtle, or bulbasaur is it the same for everyone for a particular stop or is it random?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think it was the same for everyone last time it was a quest
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But don't quote me on it @Elizabeth Kidd Yost . I could b wrong
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thanks! I just put one the web site so I wondered. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Stupid question: Alohan Pokémon don’t give you xp for new dex entries right? As in Alohan Persian isn’t a new dex entry if you already have Persian?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Correct, @Ian Fraser 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Darren May Hey can you avoid opening the gift I sent you for 4 days? Trying to get 5 people in a line for maximizing empty xp. 
Darren May  ----->  I’ll try but no promises when I’m falling asleep opening my gifts in bed
Ian Fraser  ----->  If you open the one I sent you today and just send me one I can hold off on it. Apparently I sent you a gift when I woke up and another gift a couple hours later. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  You didn’t even give me a heads up last night @Darren May that’s two ultra freindos that i got stiffed on some double xp  yesterday. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I guess we're not really you're ultra friends...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Heckin’ robbed, I tell ya. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  With friends like y’all, who needs empty xp
Joseph Spalding  ----->  lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Anybody know who veptavis is?
David Busby  ----->  Never heard of them
Ian Fraser  ----->  I got the same one @Elizabeth Kidd Yost no clue who they are 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I nearly got hit in the head by a falling tree branch at arb but I got my spinda. 
David Busby  ----->  Wait y’all two posted trainer code outside of here or mystic?
Ian Fraser  ----->  I think I posted it once in Mystic main when it first came out but never other than that......
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Mine is on the web page and I posted in mystic when it first came out. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @David Busby i joined mystic legions on face book and found some long distance friends.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I am very unknowledgeable about any generation of pokemon except the first. So does anyone know the reason Kecleon isn't in the game yet?
David Busby  ----->  Would have to figure out a way to incorporate the silph scope(is that what it is) in game. Basically there’s an item you have to use to see kecleon
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ah. I thought it was something like that. They'll probably just make it like Mew eventually
Sam Kawell  ----->  As in it will turn invisible sometimes, not that it will come through special research
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Ian Fraser Your code is on the website. Her name is Katelyn and I think I might know who she is. I’ll have to investigate further. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Ian Fraser Do you know Katelyn Spencer?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nope no clue who she is. So she just got it from the website? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Only Katelyn I know is Parker’s gf
David Busby  ----->  ^exactly why I didn’t give lee my trainer code 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Her dad is the general manager at the tiger town CFA and she worked there for a while. I think that might be who it is. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  That level 27 catching two shinies with a gotcha kind of makes me angry
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wait what level 27? 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  True definition of casual, had to leave the house in time to spin a stop and complete a task before midnight 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh man that’s me during the semester levels of casual. That’s pretty bad. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  True definition of casual, had to leave the house in time to spin a stop and complete a task before midnight 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell kleckon is like ninjas split evo. It relies on it ability and the unique encounter like David mentioned. They have not added abilities so it will prob get ditto treatment 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  In Stockholm now. Go out and get it now! 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I miss the days when I new everyone in the chat.
Ian Fraser  ----->  They fixed the berry visual glitch..and introduced a worse one that screws with quick catching if you berry the mon.

https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/957prm/how_to_crash_on_01114/?st=JKJ7HI0W&sh=7bd93152
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  ?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Good question
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Interesting. Mr spoofer or out of town with a rare regional? Who knows
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also screw volbeat. Only seen two and they both like a mile away. Very few uncommon or rarer bug spawns here
David Busby  ----->  Probably need rainy weather
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Dodrio don’t nest, right?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Almost certainly not, but my brother and I could have sworn that there was a "nest" in downtown Birmingham. There were like four or five dotrios in the same area on multiple trips downtown.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Yeah I think they’ve dramatically upped the spawn rate in PC weather. They’re super common in Houston 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  And still completely useless
Sam Kawell  ----->  And how many doduos? Bc we saw none
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Same. I see them here and there but nowhere near as common as dodrio
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hmm...
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  It’s weird
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  WTH is this?  This is what happens when I try to open pogo right now. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  It’s been reported on Silph. Happened a while back too but looks like it’s returned, may or may not be same cause/fix. You iPhone or android?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Deleting the app and reinstalling seems to be the only fix
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  iPhone 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  That’s what I thought. Not sure it matters tbh, seems that delete/reinstall is the fix for both platforms
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Oh Leslie...🤦🏻‍♂️
Ian Fraser  ----->  Idk if you’ve read up in the relevant chat but it really is just because she said it was hers. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I didn’t see the original conversation but I did see it get referenced. I don’t think she’s ever really held the library down though. Not like y’all hold down campus.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  But honestly if I had gold 10x over on a gym I probably wouldn’t have much motivation other than getting my daily coins to fight that hard for it
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Darren May @Keaton Rhea I will be opening the ultra friend gifts sometime between 9am and 12pm. I’ll tag you about 15-30 mins before. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Michelle U I don’t have a gift from you but I’ve sent you one and I assume you’re waiting to open it till tomorrow. Please tag me before you do. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well campus is easy because there’s simply so casuals. Also Keaton and I usually drop them before anyone is awake lol. But yea, after getting gold on a gym I basically just try to get my coins and stop caring. 
David Busby  ----->  Leslie doesn’t know how to take stuff down though. Poke at the gym let them berry then hit me again 15 minutes later. It’s not like your going anywhere. She could also hold the gym if she dropped actual counters 
David Busby  ----->  Defenders. I’m tired af sorry lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s creepy
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Ian Fraser Wasn’t sure if making a joke about 12 and 17 both being illegal was appropriate in mystic chat so I’m somewhat making it here
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I also didn’t know if someone in there actually IS in that age bracket and didn’t want to get any sort of restraining order against me
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  But on that note, gotta get to sleep
Ian Fraser  ----->  In AL only illegal if you’re more than...two years older I think? That wasn’t a proud moment in my life. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Doubt it in Mystic. Pretty sure Erin isn’t actually in that range. 😂 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Amanda could you send a gift my way this morning? We're getting to ultra today and I'd like to string you with my brother.
Blaine, E  ----->  Also, we are going to be ultra friends today @Darren May and I wasnt sure if you cared when I opened your gift
Darren May  ----->  @Blaine, E No, I don’t care (in a good way)
Sam Kawell  ----->  Is there a good way to not care about someone's friendship?
David Busby  ----->  Oh god @Keaton Rhea does Donahue always get super effed for school morning traffic?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yes
David Busby  ----->  Welp looks like I have to find another way to work 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Wire
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I take back way near MLK park
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I'm going to village lot
David Busby  ----->  If I’m going to Zoes you think I do that or go college? Or try to find some back way
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Uhhh idk about that. It's gonna suck regardless
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Maybe just cry? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm far enough west I don't use Donahue unless I have to 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So you think there are still spoofers in Madison?
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Keaton Rhea @Darren May I’m about to open them. I’ll hold off on Keaton’s for a few minutes if you want to pop a lucky. Darren I know you don’t care :P
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Go ahead. I don't care
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If any one else wants to open my gifts go ahead. I'm not going to care about it until best friends. I'll b at 41 ultra friends after today assuming 3 more gifts get opened.... I don't need much not empty exp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E tell Emily to open it when ever
Blaine, E  ----->  She was waiting for an egg spot to open for alolan distance, but I will let her know you don't care
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks @Ian Fraser ! Broke 41M tonight 
Ian Fraser  ----->   > says tonight

> it’s 11am

> hope Europe is fun! 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's almost 6PM here
Blaine, E  ----->  So it's almost your bedtime
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nah gotta stay up. Dinner is at like 7
Ian Fraser  ----->  ...that explain why he was in GroupMe at 12am last night CST! Just clicked for me lol, almost said something about it being past your bedtime. 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah 7 hr diff
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I figured the screen capture times would give it away
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And the gifts from Stockholm and Bern 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  There are 3 or 4 about to hit ultra wasn't sure if anyone wanted lucky egg or not.
Sam Kawell  ----->  So I just realized that the trading event ends the day before the August 20th update that will limit research reward stacking. Does this mean something big is happening in the update?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm waiting on a last minute notice about community day. If you already have 5 or 6 thousand eevee candies and I don't they will be shinny??? What are we catching 2 days worth for??
Amanda  ----->  Sooo...should we let Valor continue to try to bully Leslie out of Library because they are, or let them rot in the library and keep them out of every other gym in Auburn during the day?
Amanda  ----->  She definitely has bad gym etiquette because she’ll knock them out of Opelika and farther out gyms after only minutes, but...
David Busby  ----->  She was also dumb enough to claim it as her gym. I’m cool to mess with valor though
Joseph Spalding  ----->  She brought that all on by herself, but I’m with David on this. 
David Busby  ----->  I’ve gotta take this delivery order at 3 but I’ll go clear it out around 4
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm a bad person @Amanda i have zero gym etiquette lol. But I blame the storm for that.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  B a gym bully! 
David Busby  ----->  Oh rip to me I’m getting car fixed. Might make my way out there later 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think I just read something maybe shinny eevee???
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yep! That's why we were given two days
Ian Fraser  ----->  So basically RIP the Leafon and Glaceon dream. :(((
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So, I have a goal for tomorrow and will definitely be hitting gyms hard. I’ll share if I reach my goal. I think it’s mainly Pete that is taking down the library. Talked to him this morning and he was pretty irritated about Leslie claiming the gym. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm still waiting. I hope more gets added at the last minute for CD.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  For now I'll be a casual shinny checker 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost will you be getting to 40 this weekend?
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser I'm as disappointed as you are, but as long as we hold onto a couple shinies, we can get them with the name trick whenever they come out.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Good point
Sam Kawell  ----->  Cause the special move really isn't meta even for the eeveelutions
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I should get 4 ultra friends tomorrow so that should definitely happen 😜
Sam Kawell  ----->  Dang. I totally forget about ultra friends
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Awesome @Elizabeth Kidd Yost I just passed the halfway mark today
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It shouldn’t take much time at all @Joseph Spalding! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I do kinda feel like I’m cheating with these friendship bonuses though. 
David Busby  ----->  *whispers* empty xp is real
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I haz teh monz to back my XP up doe!
Michelle U  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost @Joseph Spalding please let me know before you open my gifts tomorrow so I can be ready for that empty xp!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ll be lucky egged all day walking around disney, so just lmk when you’re ready
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ll send you a gift in the morning and you can open it whenever you want. I’m not going to lucky egg tomorrow. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I think my Kangashkhan source is a spoofer...
David Busby  ----->  Hate to say I told you so 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Atodaso. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol everyone is filling up on dat empty exp
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Keaton’s gonna be hurting when he gets home - look how late he was up ^😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Our flight leaves at 730AM.we get into Atl at like 2PM CT. It's going to b bad @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've also not slept much at all since getting here. 5hrs tops a night, usually less bc I can't adjust
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hopefully I'll crash when I get back
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I did get one finally
Keaton Rhea  ----->  3 in a row. Maybe they nest? 
David Busby  ----->  Dibs! 
David Busby  ----->  On one of them or a mr mike 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Dibs on a vol and a mime if ya have enough
Darren May  ----->  Quality Facebook memory
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Mission accomplished!
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May that's amazing
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm also really impressed you had a Machamp one month into the game
David Busby  ----->  Wasn’t samford a machop nest like right off the bat 
Darren May  ----->  Yes, not that I knew what a nest was at the time. That was my strongest poke. Who knows what the ivs were on some of those
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ah, I didn't move to AU until mid August
Ian Fraser  ----->  Pretty sure Samford was Poliwag originally. I remember walking around there at 2am trying to get a Poliwrath with Bubble when it was basically the best defensive move. Saved up 125 candies finally to evolve it. Know what it had? 
Darren May  ----->  Yeah there was poliwag, machop, and I think abra early on. Also centennial park was a separate nest. Remember it being jigglypuff and vulpix. Now nothing spawns there 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wow. It's easy to forget the terror of a bad moveset. The times before TMs were dark. My first Dragonite was Hyper Beam...
David Busby  ----->  Bite flash cannon on my first blastoise
David Busby  ----->  Back before I knew how bad blastoise was 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh my gosh, Blastoise was my bane. I loved him in the main series, and really wanted a WG HP but it took like 4 for me to finally get one.
Darren May  ----->  I mean I only have 9 Blastoise currently 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol my oldest. @Ian Fraser I waste those poli candies
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry no dibbs until I come back and weigh trading options with real sleep
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Now it's basically dead zombie mode
David Busby  ----->  No dibs have been called and are sacred
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Right. He who hold the dibs, controls the universe
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So what we need is a plain ticket to Atlanta with layovers in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia.
David Busby  ----->  Don’t forget New Zealand 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I figure if we land in Sydney we can boat over and back lol.
Phil Pearson  ----->  It’s a long ferry ride
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  In case you missed it elsewhere. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Welcome to stardust grinding club
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser @Blaine, E @Michelle U you're next
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And @Joseph Spalding 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😂 @Daniel R 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I just passed the 3 mil mark, so not to long
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Too*
Blaine, E  ----->  I would be lucky to hit it before graduation 😅 
Michelle U  ----->  ^Lol! Was about to say that. Pretty sure im gonna graduate before I get there XD. @Joseph Spalding is so close tho!
Michelle U  ----->  Congrats @Elizabeth Kidd Yost !! 😀
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thanks!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wow, I really am a bad ultra friend. I guess I just assumed @Joseph Spalding already was there
Joseph Spalding  ----->  The worst @Sam Kawell 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I doubt I’ll hit 40 before spring semester...but Jan-May Catie will be gone and I’ll be looking to be less casual to help me forget that fact. Sooooo maybe 40 before I graduate. I’ll be at 38 by this weekend. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  With all the empty exp they keep adding to the game, I'd b amazed if Michelle, Emily and Ian were not 40 a year from now. You guys have not even hit the best friend mark with anyone yet
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, too afraid to tag bc of how late it is back home haha
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It took me 2 months to go from 38 to 39 and three months to go from 39 to 40 - in the summer when I don’t play as much. The friendship bonuses really made a big difference. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea looks like you have a new Machamp solo challenge
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm working on it! Pinap them all
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Got some weather boosted
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And a few candies
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looks like I can prob do it with the trash i have already by just using TMs but it has to be boosted I think
Blaine, E  ----->  @David Busby @Sam Kawell  we become ultra friends today! I forget if you guys care about the XP, if so let me know please �
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'd like a heads-up pls!
Blaine, E  ----->  will do!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It didn’t take long for me to turn casual. My bag was overflowing last night and I had a headache so I went to bed without opening gifts. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  When that happens I just delete max revives and all my red balls
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was over by like 150 items and the headache made me not care. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Caught a couple heracross if anyone needs one
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Matt Inger I think it’s pointless right now. They’re berrying 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  But you know it’s serious when will drops something besides a pidgey. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Apparently West has been asking about adding the black suns to mystic chat again. He messaged Leslie about it last night. She told him to talk to try talking to Amanda. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Personally I think holding a grudge against Leslie this long is pretty damn silly. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  ...why does CWEST care? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think he’s been raiding with them a lot. 
Blaine, E  ----->  Ah! I forgot about or increased friendship! Are you awake @Sam Kawell ??
Sam Kawell  ----->  It's all good! Just put an egg on, so go for it.
Blaine, E  ----->  Done! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Got it!
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser level 38 tomorrow?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh definitely. I’m 90k off I think. I might even hit it before CD starts if I find a raid before work lol. Then the grind begins again. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Preliminary reports on TSR indicated Eevee shiny rate might be lowered...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm heading back to states now. Let me know if any one wants a Mr mime for dex entry. I got a bunch
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have ~40 but plan to keep some of them. 
David Busby  ----->  How many times does a man have to call dibs??
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess you can have one David. Gonna cost you big! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Everyone else gets them for one pidgey. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You have to give me at least two pidgey! 
David Busby  ----->  I only accept the best deals. Everyone tells me 
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Will you pretty please send me one more Swiss gift if you have it? The chetelat half of my family would appreciate it 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll send one more now. At air port now 
Cindy R  ----->  Safe travels @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks! Going to be rough time change. 
Cindy R  ----->  I can only imagine!  Lol
Cindy R  ----->  It kills me when I have to go to eastern time when traveling for work...lol. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only 7 hr difference here
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I want Mr. Mime!
Amanda  ----->  Please name one for me😁😁😁😁
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I'll do better than a Pidgey
Sam Kawell  ----->  Or maybe this would be more appropriate
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got you guys covered
Joseph Spalding  ----->  And I’ll raise you @Sam Kawell 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm zombie right now. Been up since 8:45 Pm yesterday's AU time. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll prob wait a bit to sign in but I got an awesome pidgey to show too
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Oooooooooh.  Don’t let will see that bad boi. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I will show if off to him later then
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also rip shiny eevee for today. None in the air port for me
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I have one small spawn near me out here at the beach and it sucks
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Keep that app open and check em all! 
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I only got 2...so sad...lol. we can give you a shiny from our alt acct if you dont get one tomorrow. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I hope to b recovered by tomorrow so I can actually go out
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I only have 1 empty poke spot right now tho haha
Cindy R  ----->  LOL...sounds about right!  Well we got ya covered if you dont get one.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thank you
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt do you and Jenny want a Mr mime as well? 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Keaton Rhea We would love one but I’m not sure when we would have a chance to trade you 😩
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have two devices and can log in for you and do it if your willing to sacrifice most of the day playing. Maybe during work week? I could keep your daily streaks alive 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If not I'll save two for maybe football season? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They are free to anyone in this group. I'll let everyone here take picks b4 I let anyone else touch them
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well I might trade one to chase at work. But I'm going to make him work for it. I'm going to ask for something kinda rare and useless like dunsparce or aipom
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I could give you login to trade, we can work that out one day this week when I’ll be at work
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  And if you can trade me two I’ll just trade one of them to Jenny 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Oh wait nvm can’t do that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Can't double trade sadly
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But that will work for mw
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Me
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Yeah forgot that for a minute
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I’m sure jenny wouldn’t mind giving up part of a day. She usually sleeps til like 10 anyway so if you do it in the morning she’ll barely notice 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha ok. I can do it prob any morning this week not counting tomorrow. No idea how long I'll sleep after this jet lag 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Matt Inger @Michelle U @Ian Fraser @Cindy R @Daniel R im guessing you don't need Mr mime since you didn't say anything (keep in mind I'm tired so I have to digit check) 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Double check
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m okay. Thanks though! Catie could use one however...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Added her in
Matt Inger  ----->  I have a couple, but they all suck so if you have a bunch I’d like to trade for one.  @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All of mine suck haha. All under 80% but I'm down to re roll a few! Odds are not good for us tho. I am keeping some weather boosted to solo champ, then I'm trading them
David Busby  ----->  Wait what kinda cp on weather boosted?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I count 39 with tired eyes. That includes all the ones I have named for trade too
David Busby  ----->  Is mime actually niche useful?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's hot garbage 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've run out of things to challenge me so this seems like fun haha
David Busby  ----->  Ayy I get a high level one 😍
Keaton Rhea  ----->  None of them are good. None wonder out of all of them
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol all of the top ones are worst appraisal so I figured it didn't matter. I'll let who ever pick when I trade 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Been trying to find something decent to trade you but everything cool I have is cool because it’s perfect or 666/777 and that will all change when we trade so...
David Busby  ----->  Thai pokes?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm not asking for anything. Like I said, free for everyone in here. 
David Busby  ----->  Yea but everyone in here still wants to reciprocate bro
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Keep the Thai. Or I can do two trades. Better distance for two usually
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I know you have it already but you can take one of these if you want. I see them every day
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Two trades*
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mine are kinda sad
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I always check them but very rarely is one a wonder. Most really suck
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I feel bad asking for anything bc I have a surplus of mime and I really don't need anything outside of a mega rare regional. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  What I would give for a relicanth...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or a tropius
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My gen 1 and 2 dex have been done for a long time
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gen 3 is so far away
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I’m still missing most of the regionals. Mime, Kanga, heracross, Tropius, Torkoal, relicanth....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I lack the last 3 you listed.
Michelle U  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I got a Mr. Mime last year but thanks for asking! I will take any trash u have  for distance tho 😃
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby what is better? I'm confused in Mystic chat
David Busby  ----->  Sam Harris is blue lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ohhhhh ok
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Good good. Still too tired to drive over haha
Sam Kawell  ----->  Crossed 1 mil for the first time!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ooh I need a shiny vaporeon in my life!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Ian Fraser I just want you to know that according to my records, I opened gifts from you 8/3-8/7 and you opened from me on the 8th and the 10th.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think the 9th was the night I had a headache and went to bed without opening - so oops!
Ian Fraser  ----->  All good. I realize that you’re actually keeping better track of it than me. 😂
David Busby  ----->  H
David Busby  ----->  I
David Busby  ----->  G
David Busby  ----->  Yo
David Busby  ----->  This
David Busby  ----->  Is
David Busby  ----->  Jazzy
David Busby  ----->  Hi
David Busby  ----->  Hacked
David Busby  ----->  Go
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @David Busby alcohol may be involved 
David Busby  ----->  Yes
David Busby  ----->  I let a girl add herself to the groupme and he stole it while my back was turned 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Keaton Rhea thanks for the thoughts we did a trade a while back for the mimes. Hope you made/making it home safely.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Never let anyone add themselves to the GroupMe David. Noob mistake
Ian Fraser  ----->  I do, but I watch my phone lol. 
David Busby  ----->  But what if she’s attractive?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  David, David, David
Sam Kawell  ----->  No excuse. You're obligation for this group should be greater.
Ian Fraser  ----->  If she’s attractive and not in the GroupMe already she’s probably a casual and therefore not worth it. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  You want to be the very best don’t you? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Need a real Pokemaster. She needs to be already level 40.  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Ian Fraser Keeping track of Pokémon friends seems to be the only thing in my life that I’m doing right these days. 😩
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m sorry! 😢 Much like Pokémon go life is a grind a lot of the time. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also holy crap @Erin putting Jazzy down. 😂😂
Cindy R  ----->  @Ian Fraser I cant find what you are talking about...which group?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Big group @Cindy R 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Big group. Starting with raichu raid post
Cindy R  ----->  Just found it...
Sam Kawell  ----->  I've never met that girl, but she seems really cool
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell time to go for 2M!
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Thanks @Keaton Rhea 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Apparently there’s a 100% at angles of repose for anyone at the museum that didn’t see
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is an awesome vulpix! 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  It is! Not as good as this one though 😛
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Def one of my most prized moms
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Mons
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Got 6! Yay! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok go play in the road Amanda (sarcasm) 
Amanda  ----->  Do you see those Flareon????
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm less mad bc of the Flareons
Keaton Rhea  ----->  At least you had a chance. If I don't get a jolteon I'm gonna cry. I only got 4 attempts if I get umb and esp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If I get 4 flareons, it's gonna b punt the phone into the bushes like I did with my 98 iron trail ttar
Cindy R  ----->  I only got 2 yesterday,  so was relieved to get more today.  
Cindy R  ----->  I think we may hit Montgomery for community days...the spawns are insane downtown. 
David Busby  ----->  Kinda pissed at this haul. Not one above 60% and only one with high enough cp to throw in a gym 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll take any of them off your hands if you want David..... 
David Busby  ----->  You can have one for the mime 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby was that from 6 hours?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pls b a jolteon if that is true
David Busby  ----->  Yup 
David Busby  ----->  People came away with more in 2 hours than I did in 6
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I played for about 2.5 hrs today and got about the same. I'm sorry David. Keep your shiny 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Blaine, E @Ian Fraser This Bud’s for you. Or at least named for you. 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  Only got two with good CP and two with >80% IV.
Ian Fraser  ----->  One of them will be Glaceon but I’m debating if I should roll the 818 and hope for a Vape or force an Espeon. 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Joseph Spalding @Ian Fraser I like the way both of your names combined for our shared shiny! 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No @Ian Fraser ! The 818 is now your baby never to leave your side
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Blian will be forced into an Espeon whether he likes it or not
Sam Kawell  ----->  No longer more than a million dust, but totally worth it.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nick name it up! And yes worth dust
Sam Kawell  ----->  Crap that's a lot of pressure for the nickname.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My girl was less fortunate IV wise
Sam Kawell  ----->  Aww
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I’ve got two jolteons and I’ll be happy to trade you for one. I’m hoping for a vaporeon tonight!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My mew is named after a gangsta 
Sam Kawell  ----->  What's weird is my mew still has uncertain IVs
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I got a vape and a flare on two out of my three shinies
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Still higher than me low 70% one lol. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Ill gladly trade you my vape for a jolt
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Joseph Spalding Im sorry for those rolls 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell lvl 40 should have obvious IVs. Try online Calc? 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Better than nothing if you hadn’t hooked me up, so I’m not complaining 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I can barely say Pokemon without getting a headache lol. Montgomery was endless eevees. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Glad my second phone worked long enough to get you some @Joseph Spalding !
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Keaton Rhea You can have a shiny eevee for a mime as well. I got 29 in about 4 hours...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Me too!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If someone has a chance smack @Taylor Pruitt for that lol.
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  😇
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jesus u guys got too much to give. I don't want much. I just want a jolteon shiny lol. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jolteon is my fav poke in case no one knows. 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  A peek of my day
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E lets see that shiny swablu too
Blaine, E  ----->  🤗
Matt Inger  ----->  I had a good day after getting only one yesterday
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I know everyone hates meatloaf... But its one of my favs
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Me too. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Home made way to go
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Wrong king of shiny perfect.
Amanda  ----->  Ummmmm....I LOVE meatloaf! 😍😋
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda :)
David Busby  ----->  Fun story when I was a kid I was a little shit. I ate meatloaf at the cafeteria one day and hated it because you know elementary school meatloaf sucks. So I refused to eat my moms delicious meatloaf. So I only ate oven baked hamburger 🤣
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You WERE a little shit?
David Busby  ----->  Yea now I’m an asshole
Matt Inger  ----->  That looks like my mom’s meatloaf.  Leftover meatloaf sandwiches are my favorite. Lots of gravy and cheese 🤤 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’ve never been so disappointed in my life. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I now have 4 jolteon, 3 flareon, and 0 vaporeon 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Had to like so I could unlike. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I have one of each...but I so wanted a good vaporeon... :( 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m not evolving anymore. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :/ why the hate for jolteon. That is the only one I want 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t hate jolteon but I don’t want 4 of them. Purple is my favorite color so I want all the purple shinies. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don’t hate Jolteon, but Vaporeon is my favorite so I would really have liked a good IV one.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wish I could make this guy shiny 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I wish I could trade you my shiny and not reroll the Ivs
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also Leslie is going to fight for a week to get into the Library and then drop a Hariayma when she finally does?? A HARIAYMA.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Nice, Ian. I tried to give her some subtle hints about not using aggron the other day. I’m not sure it stuck. 
Darren May  ----->  Been out of town for a week and had all my chats on mute. Do I even want to know why it’s taken Leslie a week to get into the library. #NotScrollingUp
Ian Fraser  ----->  She claimed it was hers in big chat and that pissed Pete off. 
Darren May  ----->  Ok that is funny. Sounds like something I would do if I had a job that allowed for it
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well it was funny, but they've been doing it for over a week now, so now I think it's just mean spirited
Ian Fraser  ----->  It was funny the first few days I admit. Now it’s just silly imo. Also I’m not Pete’s biggest fan so I’m okay with pushing him out. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Evo meowth in case any one missed it
Darren May  ----->  Ok well the library gym thing isn’t as funny if they are just multi-accounting to do it. Which I guess it’s valor so I should have assumed 
Amanda  ----->  Can I call out on it?? Please??
Amanda  ----->  I’ll do a Dear Valor letter
David Busby  ----->  I mean your boytoy was in on it at one point 
Amanda  ----->  He’s not doing it. Just getting dropped in☹️
David Busby  ----->  But I’m ok with it 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think they should stop bullying Leslie
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If I said Sam Harris was my gym, they would not do this to me
Amanda  ----->  Well...Adam did, but more of a fun nature.
Ian Fraser  ----->  That’s because KarKar has >2000km. It scares people. 
Amanda  ----->  Sam Harris that is.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah watch out for KarKar
Ian Fraser  ----->  I think part of it is breaking the unspoken rule. We all know certain gyms “belong” to others because they work on them or live beside them. We just don’t say that. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I figured Pete was dropping Adam and Nat bc they were both in the gym but I only saw Pete and Will pulling out of the parking lot. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't really have a problem with them fighting it to make a point, I think that's just the small competitive part of the game. What is not cool is using their account sharing to make it essentially impossible to beat. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  And I think because they've done it for so long it has become mean-spirited bullying.
Darren May  ----->  I agree with @Sam Kawell and @Keaton Rhea and I’m about to play b-ball so I think you for sharing my thoughts concisely so I don’t have to type something out
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Daniel R @Cindy R you guys been slowing down lately since there isn’t much more for y’all to play for?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  No....well some lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Honestly @Taylor Pruitt we play about 40 minutes before work and try to keep it to an hour in the afternoon. We backed off when we hit gold in all of auburn/Opelika and all surrounding gyms. We started on Montgomery but that's our casual weekends.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm disappointed that @Keaton Rhea and @Cindy R got ahead of me on exp but huckleberry has side tracked me lol.
David Busby  ----->  Wait did he finally do it??
Cindy R  ----->  Huckleberry will have a new friend!
Darren May  ----->  So this might be a dumb question but why didn’t Leslie just take the gym this morning when it was just will?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Your right.....dumb question lol. Thats like asking why didn't she golden razz a blissie at least one time.
Matt Inger  ----->  And why I have to come take it down for her.  But I do like messing with them 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We were planning to meet at 10:30 to take it and fill it up. Can’t do that if it’s already blue. Plus she probably figured they’d take it right back. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  This is that Mindy Taylor person. Not sure if she’s trying to help or just a coincidence. At least she dropped something decent. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @David Busby I’m popping for our ultra in about 20 mins 
David Busby  ----->  Rip lol taking a delivery 
Ian Fraser  ----->  If you quit your game, open it, and immediately turn an egg on, you might be able to catch the xp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip Manta bot in the rain 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  7477 0756 3379
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea any clue what meganiums move might be?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not sure. Frenzy plant? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Will they probly just do frenzy plant
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Prob gonna b useless regardless
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  My son just came running out of the laundry room to tell me that the dryer was making a funny noise. Y’all I washed my go plus again and all it’s pieces were rattling around in there! 🤦‍♀️
Darren May  ----->  That’s why I go full nerd and wear it as a bracelet 
Ian Fraser  ----->  same
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->   What’s really bad is that I couldn’t find it in my car or my purse and I knew I needed to check my pockets before I put in the laundry, but of course I forgot. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip go plus! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think Amanda said she wanted it b4 and it still worked
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What does the PCB look like? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve washed it before and it still worked. I haven’t tried connecting it yet but it still lights up. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It might b fine! I hope it is 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Started yesterday at like 11am.....
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We saw it already!  You’ve been holding out on us!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I know. I wasnt going to share until later but then I realized I need coins...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ive only done two raids too. Its all catching haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  ive been hunting down those new dex entries
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Once I hit 30 im just gonna trade over some basic counters and it's gonna b a free raid pass fodder account tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  this summer sucked for raids and it looking like im going to move to hsv in about a yr. I need to be able to hold my own solo eventually
Sam Kawell  ----->  (that like was for you coming to HVille)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looks like it would just be you, Zac, Zander and me for legit players too lol
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Can someone give me a TL;DR of all the drama going down? I know about the library stuff but anything else? Seems there’s unrest in auburn PoGo land and I don’t like it
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sounded like raid separation started today's drama.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sounds like instinct just being Instinct 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Sounds like everyone has their own side to the story
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  There’s three sides to every story: side A, side B, and the truth
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Brad has been nice to those people but I think he’s been starting to get annoyed with them. I’m not sure why or what exactly happened today. It sounds like Storm did a private group and excluded them, but I wasn’t there so I don’t know. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Mav didn’t actually address what you said and just deflected
Cindy R  ----->  Who knows....sounds like everyone wasn't there.  
Cindy R  ----->  All these immature people....Jessica just said they did do the raid.  I am out...LOL 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  If the suns are involved, it’s guaranteed to be a s$@t show. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  There’s a lesson to be learned here. 
David Busby  ----->  I’m talking to brad right now 
Cindy R  ----->  Wanted to make sure yall saw my post...stop at first pres is a spinda.
Darren May  ----->  Have to make a mental note to check out from the library gym drama. On another note, I was out of town over the weekend if anyone has surplus shiny eevees. Snookems and I made my wife get off the interstate and go to the Commerce GA Starbucks so we both caught 1.
David Busby  ----->  @Blaine, E Is pharmacy school 282 west thach concourse?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just to add about the library after we took it the other day with David we circled around to mess with jazz attacking it. It was all in fun but he made the comment about how "they"  were trying to do something with the gym, because Lesley put a target on it because of what she said in the main group. Amanda is right Lesley shouldn't take it personal, Cindy and I have been storm targets since day one lol.
Blaine, E  ----->  @David Busby  no, sorry for delay - in meeting
Ian Fraser  ----->  Means it should be Haley. I’ll check at noon. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also I think Moltres day might be on the 8th which is a home game...
Darren May  ----->  Ugh RIP
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well that would absolutely suck
Sam Kawell  ----->  I am planning on being in au that weekend too...
Ian Fraser  ----->  The safari event in Japan is August 29th - Sept 2nd and I seem to recall the bird day being on the Saturday following the event. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Two more spidna quests kinda close to first pres but on campus. One at Martin hall stop and another at harper hall (cater lawn)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Matt Inger can you send a gift to my dad alt please? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thank you
Matt Inger  ----->  You’re welcome!
Matt Inger  ----->  Pete and his crew seem to be laying off the library today
Darren May  ----->  Got really excited until I realized there is probably another regi on the way
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Seemed like a few of y’all in here would enjoy this so wanted to make sure you saw it
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost congrats?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yep!  Haven’t had a chance to post 😁
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Stalker lol.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, RIP my go plus. It worked last night but won’t work today. I tried a new battery and nothing. :(
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Can you share a Pic of the PCB? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The what?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wonder what shorted 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Nerd
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The printed circuit board. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The green thing when you change the battery
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  This?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  This?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sorry didn’t mean to post twice 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'd prob have to take it apart to see. I forgot that plastic cover was there
Sam Kawell  ----->  Thanks Blaine...
Blaine, E  ----->  🤗 that's what I'm here for
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was thinking the same thing @Blaine, E 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Chase and I rework boards all the time in lab, but idk if it will help with out replacement parts. I can look at it if you want. Blaine even burned her hair on the hot airgun today.... 
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea  this is all I can think about when you say PCB..lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’s my second one so I don’t think the hubs really wants to buy me another one. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well I can try but it's a long shot! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R i forgot that was even and acronym used for there 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Keaton Rhea why are we sharing that 😅 that was between me, you and that hot airgun...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm stuck in a world of electronics in lab haha. I take ideal nonlinear dynamical systems and attempt to emulate their chaotic response using custom analog and digital electronics in a hardware implementation. I guess you guys already knew that
Cindy R  ----->  Daniel said Beer + PCB = Relaxation 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've tried to solder after a few beers. Not very relaxing.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also do not have steady hands. 
Cindy R  ----->  HAHAHA...I should not have laughed so hard thinking of your burnt fingertips 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I don't burn my self. If just can not get the damn parts in the right spot. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Chase is the expert, so when I mess it all up, he has to fix it
Joseph Spalding  ----->  The Navy’s Miniature/Microminiature Electronics Repair c-school was one of the harder things I’ve had to do. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Doing trace repairs on a 7 layer board with a 10x loupe suuuuuuuuuuuuuucks
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah no thank you. We do 2 later boards mostly. Some 4
Keaton Rhea  ----->  2 layer
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That was our “final” practical, and of course they picked a spot where 4 traces crossed. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope. I'd of just cried in the corner. I'd you need work we need our ASIC to be wire bonded and packaged. Can't even pay you but it will b painful haha
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Id love to help. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If you need. Man I can't txt
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We want the fab lab to do it. But who knows. It was a cheapo run of like 4k and I doubt it will even work haha
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’m so nerdy, i even have my own reflow/work station at home. lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've always had a lab and key to go to so never needed one
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I do repairs on car audio amplifiers on the side mostly. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ooo you like dank speakers? 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  If you saw my s-10, you’d know. Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I may or may not of spent a good bit of money on my many speakers..... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't like bass heavy music. I'm more about clarity
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It’s last iteration had just shy of 36kW of power. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nice! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Even tho that would give me a headache lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pimp truck
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think your suspension is broken dude.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Flat tires @Sam Kawell 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Now it is working @Keaton Rhea. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Confused? @eliz

Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry been at dinner
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  My go plus is working now. Weird. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  From you @Keaton Rhea 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ready for Regirock like:
Ian Fraser  ----->  My goal is to have all 6 be brelooms by the end. 
GroupMe  ----->  David Busby removed Ian Fraser from the group.
GroupMe  ----->  David Busby added Ian Fraser to the group.
David Busby  ----->  Machamp op 🤨
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yep lol. But Breloom isn’t very far behind per this chart and I have to have some way to keep myself entertained through a month of another boring Regi. 
David Busby  ----->  Really ogre and champ both have max dps of 11.4 in neutral weather so I’ll be using ogre then champ. Might throw in my hundo Groudon for giggles cause of survivability and the fact that short manning this raid is not a real short man 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby I accidently opened your gift without realizing it pushed us to Ultras. If you want it, throw a lucky egg on as soon as you open the game 
Phil Pearson  ----->  I did the same I think 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Ian Fraser breloom can actually be good in cloudy weather; however, he is like jynx. Wet paper towel. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  With significantly less dps advantage over Machamp than Jynx has over rayray
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah no double type advantage. Basically, if anything but sunny or rain, use a team of 6 lvl 40 champ/ogre. In sunny, vena and exe. Rain obviously kyogre
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I already have a chart but it's on my lab pc
Sam Kawell  ----->  I have top sunny counter bring Groudon
Darren May  ----->  Yawn...casual alert
Sam Kawell  ----->  But I guess that's a combo move that few people have/want
Phil Pearson  ----->  @Darren May Same
Sam Kawell  ----->  Actually mud shot earthquake is the same as exeggutor and Venusaur
Ian Fraser  ----->  So sunny weather is bring 6 exeggutors? 

And yea I know Breloom is far worse than Machamp...I’m just going to try to make that my team for fun since this month is going to be pretty raid boring otherwise. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was wrong @Sam Kawell groudon is best sunny. I still prob won't power one up since I like to use my 5 lvl 40 hundo exeggutor
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wait... I'm getting 13.1DPS out of VW/FP vena
Keaton Rhea  ----->  12.2 out of groudon
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Exe 12.2 as well
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But groudon MS hits a break point with just great friends, which makes it better. Vena and  exe do not hit any on quick moves
David Busby  ----->  Still go sob over eq right 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes but they are pretty much the same
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I think you're right. I just double checked some things.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The break point of great+ frands can make groudon better in sun 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't think there are any other notable ones in weather
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well quick moves that is
Darren May  ----->  One of the silph infographics has metagross as a top counter. Say what? I think I’m going to go the @Ian Fraser route and create a fun team. Or be 1 and done
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Metagross with ultra + snowy hits a nice DPS point... Outside of that don't use it haha
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell Will you come back to auburn for the celebi photo op with me, @Keaton Rhea and @David Busby?
David Busby  ----->  Idk I might be in the race to get it done first. Didn’t have the time last time 
David Busby  ----->  Rip I work all day 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Why is that not the avatar for main group???
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I'll definitely be in town the weekend of the 8th if we can finish it by then.
Sam Kawell  ----->  *September 8th
David Busby  ----->  Oh I mean help out with the alt btw Keaton 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That Owen guy from big grewp said he been grinding for a few weeks. My alt is already past him and it started mon... That ain't grinding Owen
Ian Fraser  ----->  Anyone know why it’s recommending my Mahchamps against a boosted Machamp? Is Machamp just that good...?
Ian Fraser  ----->  That’s in cloudy weather
David Busby  ----->  No because Lugia still isn’t doing the damage a mewtwo will 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay...? I’m confused. I mean it says I can still solo it with that. And if I set the weather as non cloudy it goes back to recommending the psychic types you would expect. Soooo boosted Machamps dmg is better that Alakazam and Espeon against a raid boss Machamp? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well according to my calculations it will only do around 80% mewtwos damage (85% Espeon), so maybe pokegenie goes for a combination of dps and survivability?
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Blaine, E really creative name there...
Blaine, E  ----->  🙈 I get trade happy and just forgot to rename him! I just renamed for you 🤗
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hahaha, much better. I like the personal touch
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I see walk and I think pantera
Darren May  ----->  That was my brother and his wife’s song at the end of their wedding that they came back up the aisle to. True story 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Your bother and his wife are cool in my book. Don't know them, but A plus on the song
Darren May  ----->  We did 8 days a week by the Beatles at my wedding but I’m kinda old fashioned 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Super duper big update just dropped
Ian Fraser  ----->  FRIENDSHIP QOL ENHANCEMENTS
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Amanda they fixed the berry glitch!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I was gonna have to look into that. Mystastic account got it.
Sam Kawell  ----->  It's beautiful. You can see if the friendship has increased
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  No update for us yet 😕
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I never sen to get them until after everyone else. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Seem
David Busby  ----->  iOS gets it late
David Busby  ----->  Idk if your apple or not Daniel
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well use apkmirror to download the updates as soon as they drop. But you can't do that in iOS
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just say no...to Apple lol 
Sam Kawell  ----->  But you guys get AR+
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Oooohhhh...aaaaaah
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Not me on iPhone6
Darren May  ----->  New level 40?
Sam Kawell  ----->  He's probly an Ausey. We know from finding Nemo that eac = east Australian current
Ian Fraser  ----->  How do you not have AR+ on iPhone 6 @Elizabeth Kidd Yost ? I have it on my SE so I figured it would definitely be on a better version of iPhone 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Candy ralts  at my house. If anyone wants me to log on for them and catch it I will. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought AR+ was only on iphone6s and higher. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Ian Fraser The SE has the same chip s the 6s 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Right, that’s what I thought. I’ve definitely got AR+ though. It’s how I got my first three excellents in a row 😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t have a 6s. The 6 doesn’t have ar+
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ohhhh gotcha. Huh, I thought my chip was the same as the 6 not the 6s. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Absol at Davis. @Darren May want to do it? 
Darren May  ----->  In a meeting. What time does it end?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  25min left 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If not then don't worry about it
Darren May  ----->  😬 prolly not then
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Don't worry 
Phil Pearson  ----->  I have kangas for everyone for when I’m in the field. Taylor is going to take over my account 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Phil Pearson if you could find a level 1 kanga I'd super duper appreciate it.
Sam Kawell  ----->  But I'll take anythinf
Phil Pearson  ----->  They’re rare but I’ll keep a look out 
Phil Pearson  ----->  This one is already reserved for you
Phil Pearson  ----->  Got one for snookems too
Darren May  ----->  Oh he will lose his mind when I tell him
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Phil Pearson If you can save one for Kookookitty she would be so excited. I think kids will actually be able to trade soon. 😬
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What is it you will be working on @Phil Pearson , in the field?
Matt Inger  ----->  I asked that same question and since he is probably out chasing wild dragons, I’ll share his response:   

Evolutionary ecology of reptiles. I’m going to be looking at the nesting behaviors of bearded dragons and the effects of their choices on their offspring
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->   He’s probably in bed 😉
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well that's cool
Sam Kawell  ----->  Since when was pseudo allowed back in the main group?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Or did I miss something last night.
Darren May  ----->  They put him back in this morning 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If he gets rowdy without being provoked he’ll get kicked again. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I hope they release some good new stuff on Monday. I have very little desire to catch anything right now and with my go plus acting up I’m not collecting much dust. 😕
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just a few hours ago. I'm sure there was some agreement. Jazz chimed in almost immediately about hanging out with him.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I 100% did not take off half a day of work to cook some ribs. That in no way happened..... 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Dang.... That's a lot of ribs
Keaton Rhea  ----->  One serving! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I am so happy I got my new smoker. I used to have to cut them in half.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yum!  Our smoker hasn’t been working. Last time Keven smoked a butt he had to finish it in the oven :(
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Poor smoker :( is it electric? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Propane. There’s something wrong with a valve I think. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh ok yeah please b careful with that. I moved away from propane bc of safety. I have two electric smokers now
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😕
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nothing wrong with it if you watch it! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I just like that I can play a match of KF2 or watch TV with a more sound mind with electric 
Cindy R  ----->  So party at @Keaton Rhea 's house!? LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol this is for tomorrow. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But yes party 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He keeps a pretty close eye on it. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm not saying he doesn't! I'm just saying I'm an odd ball and uncomfortable with gas now. I do enjoy a gas range tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Started mon at like 11ish. Those casuals can never complain about a lvl 30 mystic join minimum
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only 1 t5 raid too. Its all catches and new dex entry
Cindy R  ----->  we started huckleberry in Jan and it's up to level 37
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Does huckleberry need a fran?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Frand?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  7477 0756 3379
Cindy R  ----->  Always!  2149 9141 4010
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Added!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr has like 4 ttar I think now. Two vap and a jolteon. He is dead weight, but still better then 90%of the plebs in main chat. He is about to have 6 lvl 25 champ too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well... Scratch that. Ill just power then up to lvl 30 on Sr and wait for lvl 28 on jr
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also think the secret to good bbq is loud metal music and time. That combo seems to always work out
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Thats been my secret for going on 20 years now
Cindy R  ----->  Yep, college kids are back...2 guys barely old enough to drink carrying a case of Bush lite... 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ewww gross. I can't handle bad drinks anymore. Today was move in day
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All the children back
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess I'm part of the hated children bc I'm technically in skool... But I don't leave 
Cindy R  ----->  Naahhh...you dont count...lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  My wife would surely say I’m a child. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Same for my wife... 
Cindy R  ----->  I say the same about Daniel...its a pretty common conclusion to come too.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Man=child
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  But I do spend half of my day playing Pokémon Go while my husband is at work so I can’t really talk 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Keaton Rhea mystastic sent jr. a frand req, he's trying to get out more lol.
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Do you want me to rage you before I open for ultra? It’ll be later tonight unfortunately. :( 
Ian Fraser  ----->  .... *tag  😅
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes pls rage
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sure. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ll be up late @Ian Fraser 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Trying to decide if I should lucky egg this friendship like.. 🤔🤔🤔
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m ready @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Go for it @Ian Fraser 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I put out an egg and then thought oh I should evolve some stuff but I’ve been transferring all my rats and pidgey 😂
Phil Pearson  ----->  Not having to mass evolve is sooo nice
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I know, right? I figure I’ll just transfer everything and collect candies and if they ever increase the levels I’ll be ready!
Phil Pearson  ----->  Exactly 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’ve been transferring all them because I simply don’t have the space atm
Phil Pearson  ----->  I currently have almost 50 kangas and that’s some serious space
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And we appreciate that Phil!
Phil Pearson  ----->  @Daniel R Huckleberry has one too
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Very cool. 😁 
Phil Pearson  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Kaitlin(?) too
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thank you!  If only the announcement wasn’t so vague about this new platform. You even spelled her name right!
Phil Pearson  ----->  I figured from the ks in the user name lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  There are so many different ways!
Phil Pearson  ----->  Tell me about it. Out of the 300 students I had at Auburn I had at least 40 and at least 5 or 6 different spellings 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  My husband had two rules when we were naming her 1) he didn’t want a “k” name and 2) he wanted a common name bc his parents spelled his name weird and he never could find anything with his name printed on it correctly. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  She has a k name and the third most common spelling of Kaitlin - we hardly ever find anything with her name spelled right 😩
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost try finding a Keaton spelled out.... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😂 I bet it’s a lot like trying to find “Keven”
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Psssh. Y’all should try finding a Joe. I literally, can’t even. 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Amanda did you figure out your raikou problem? Mine continuously won't load
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh no @Blaine, E!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I still don't have an update. Did anyone have the blue screen and get fixed by the update?
David Busby  ----->  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/98ahaa/trainers_may_receive_their_deleted_stacks_late/?st=JL0BEC18&sh=3a8724f3
David Busby  ----->  @Amanda @Blaine, E 
Ian Fraser  ----->  That’s slightly different than the berry bug btw @David Busby 
David Busby  ----->  Oh dang I was speed reading my bad guys 🤦‍♂️
Ian Fraser  ----->  In theory they “have” to fix the berry bug before they delete everyone’s >100 stacks permanently...but who the hell knows. 
Blaine, E  ----->  It now isn't loading anything 🤷‍♀️ 
Amanda  ----->  @Blaine, E Mine is just when I click on the encounter and I have to force close the app
Blaine, E  ----->  Okay thank! @Amanda 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Blaine, E @Ian Fraser I finally got off my bum and evolved our guy!😁
Blaine, E  ----->  😍 I saw when I sent you a gift earlier! My bum is still walking ours 😅
Ian Fraser  ----->  Got mine yesterday. Blaine being a slowpoke. 
Blaine, E  ----->  I may or may not have prioritized umbreon 🤷‍♀️
Ian Fraser  ----->  Your first mistake. Aliens > blue racing stripes. 
Blaine, E  ----->  😍 @Sam Kawell 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I did umbreon first two. Espeon is just so...green. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also your dust gives me anxiety @Joseph Spalding 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I need another shiny eevee for umbreon. Anyone have an extra?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Me too ian
David Busby  ----->  Man kinda want to blow all 500k of mine just to make Ian and Sam uncomfortable
Amanda  ----->  I’m a fan of comfortable 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  In my defense, i just brought this guy up to lv40
Blaine, E  ----->  10/10 worth it
Darren May  ----->  I evolved my one shiny to umbreon. I would take more
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’d be happy to give you a jolteon and/or flareon. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Joseph Spalding noice, but it really would be better with Shadow ball
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Amanda @Blaine, E the berry bug is fixed by the newest update that is rolling out, but I'm pretty sure it's not on the apple app store yet. Most people theorize it'll be forced either today or tomorrow morning before Celebi drops
Sam Kawell  ----->  And @Blaine, E he's beautiful! I went for Umbreon too
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’m TM poor @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well that's a bummer...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ll rectify that situation soon enough, though. Rest assured.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Good good. I'm super jelly of you tho
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have this guy but he’s only level 9 😩
Blaine, E  ----->  @Sam Kawell I have an android and still don't have the update. Should I?
Ian Fraser  ----->  I would wait till it’s pushed through the play store. It’ll definitely be before the 20th so. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  But yea it’s fixed in the newest update! Can’t believe I missed that. 😅
Cindy R  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Unless you plan to use it all the time I would wait.  I have several little perfects I am just sitting on.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh I am waiting for sure @Cindy R.  I have a level 34 gengar with 15 attack so I’m definitely not ready to use all my dust on a low level perfect. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Blaine, E there is always the chance there is a bug in the update if you get it early, but I always get them as soon as they get released. If you want it, you can use this site
https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/niantic-inc/pokemon-go/
Cindy R  ----->  The playstore finally had the update for me.
Blaine, E  ----->  Thanks @Sam Kawell !
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Nothing for iOS yet 🙁
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea but cloudy weather won’t matter if they don’t have min 3 Machamps. @David Busby 
Ian Fraser  ----->  And I haven’t known Hunter to have good counters 
David Busby  ----->  Fair enough
Blaine, E  ----->  Update did fix the bug😁
Darren May  ----->  “Lucky” raikou. Sigh...
Sam Kawell  ----->  #2thetop
Amanda  ----->  Me too 😁🤗🤗🤗
Ian Fraser  ----->  Still nothing for iOS...doesn’t Celebi come out today? 
Phil Pearson  ----->  Supposed to..
Phil Pearson  ----->  It’s annoying because it new things start at 6am here so y’all will be half way through when I wake up
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’s annoying for me that things start at 3 here because that is when I stop playing for the day 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Sorry guys. I guess celebi will be an Android exclusive...
Ian Fraser  ----->  😡😡😡😡😡😡
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sitting in traffic and checking for update...😩
Darren May  ----->  Didn’t they have to release a new update over the weekend to fix bugs from last week’s update? That would make the iOS schedule pretty tight for 3pm today 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I haven’t had a client side update since the day before Eevee day 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is y you don't buy the ipoopy
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  But I love my ipoopy. And my kids have kindles and I despise them. 
Darren May  ----->  So there is v0.115.2 that came out the end of last week on android. Then they released v0.115.3 yesterday for android, presumably to fix something in .115.2
Darren May  ----->  iOS will get it last but it should at least work by then. Well niantic level of work at least
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The only two ipoopy devices in our house are Carroll's iPad and iPhone. The only time I use them is when they are 'broken' aka won't do what she wants
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm sure they will push some half assed update by noon today for ipoopy. 
Darren May  ----->  Idk. It normally takes a day or 2 for the updates to go through whatever apple’s App Store review process is. Going to be a close one. But hey I live for this kind of manufactured drama
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well Jr got a good rai.....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Stupid Jr taking my good pokes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yay bag space! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I just got a good rai too. Hi five to junior ✋🏻 @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Joseph Spalding @Darren May Davis? 
Darren May  ----->  Just give me a time. Assuming we have enough people to do it
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I can do it at ~11:30
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm here now with Emily now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And catie 
Darren May  ----->  Ok omw 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  On my way 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We inside bc its hot
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Passing foy, b there soon
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Still no pogo 😐
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The friendship glitch where only one person advanced when a gift was open is completely fixed now right?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I believe they fixed that a week after it came out
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Alright. Trying to help someone on the fb page and wanted to be sure to give correct info. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well it looks like some new quests are in the network traffic whatever that means...
Sam Kawell  ----->  Maybe 11 more minutes?
Darren May  ----->  Um silver pinap berry...boosts catch rate and gives double candy. Hype!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Snap!
Sam Kawell  ----->  It's here!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Even for ipoopy 😜
Ian Fraser  ----->  Not for me... :(
Ian Fraser  ----->  I have the quest but no client side update yet...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t have an update but I have the quests. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May Where do you get he silver piano?  From stops?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  *pinap not piano. Grr 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was like silver piano. Fancy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I know one way is thru celebi quest (I think) 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They seem to b a mix of pinap and golden razz. In between regular red and golden but with extra candy 
Amanda  ----->  Ya’ll see Mattdaddy in the big chat?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t think I know him. 
Darren May  ----->  He posted a gym this morning in mystic too
Amanda  ----->  I missed it’s
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Who is that? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like my new bug
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thank you @Joseph Spalding 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My old one left a lot to be desired haha
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Other than its exotic origin. Love me some USVI and BVI
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well traveled bug! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Pogo+ users: I don't know if this has been posted before, but if you catch a Pokemon with the go plus today it counts as catching Pokemon in two straight days....
Cindy R  ----->  That didn't work for me. 😢
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Let's be friends in Pokémon GO! My Trainer Code is 2149 9141 4010!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If anyone is not friends with huckleberry
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  2149 9141 4010
Sam Kawell  ----->  Aww...
Ian Fraser  ----->  Still no iOS client side update...c’mon guys I just want QOL friend changes...
David Busby  ----->  Not sure if you’re still awake but thanks for the gift. I only had like ten to send today
David Busby  ----->  At Sam. God I’m sick of these doubles 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Ian Fraser I’m hoping we’ll get it in the morning. 😡 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby doubles?
Sam Kawell  ----->  So the go+ trick didn't actually work. Booo....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well this seems odd but on our mystastic account I just started going for Mew....i know I'm casual but it's doing both mew and celbi challenges so raids count towards both.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes, you can do both at the same time
David Busby  ----->  I’ve been working a crapload of doubles so open and closing @Sam Kawell 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Joseph Spalding  ----->  F
Sam Kawell  ----->  F
Sam Kawell  ----->  Dang it Keaton you broke the game
Keaton Rhea  ----->  A bunch of mine do that now but it is random at launch. 
Phil Pearson  ----->  Still no trades...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :( I'll trade with you @Phil Pearson 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I still need to complete over 700 trades to get the 1k trade medal
Phil Pearson  ----->  Once Taylor gets my account I’ll have a lot of distance 
Phil Pearson  ----->  I seriously have kangas for everyone 
Phil Pearson  ----->  Except the casuals
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She is waiting on you! 
Phil Pearson  ----->  Yay!!
Phil Pearson  ----->  And she’s excited to meet you
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She is going to 40 after I get more candies
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I need to see you so I can get my Mr. Mime! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I can only do one per day. So anytime I get I chance I'm giving one away! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  By the way, Jin says he can fix my Go Plus 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I spent my one special trade today on Emily's vulpix. So blame her
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Good glad he can fix it! 
Blaine, E  ----->  -_-@Keaton Rhea 
Blaine, E  ----->  #worthit
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I double checked, and it actually stayed the same CP too! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Our stardust is almost identical 
Blaine, E  ----->  Again I repeat "-_-" , and yes, I did not name my vulpix "NotForEmily" �
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I’m a casual now. I’ve already ignored a larvitar, a miltank and now a lunatone on my nearby this morning 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well it was right outside so I figured I'd call it
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I just did an exponential fit on the xp per level from level 30 to 40 and if that trend continues when they increase the level cap, you'll just be level 43...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol rip pasta. I wont mind it tho! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I just broke 42M today. I need to hurry up to 60M
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yep. That'll get you to 45. To get to 50, it'll be 185M, so get grinding
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lucky time it is! I've gone too casual haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lucky egg*
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Stop it i still haven't made it to 40 mill yet lol. Stupid alt accounts.
Darren May  ----->  Ive been casualling pretty hard so are any of the boxes a good deal?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They are only good if you value both incubators and raid passes. And only the highest one is worth it. I read it on slilph and did zero analysis on it tho 
Matt Inger  ----->  I had to go with the great box cause it’s the only one with the star pieces 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wish I could give you some star pieces. I forget to use them all the time 
Darren May  ----->  Hmm might be worth it for the celebi quest based on the spoilers thus far
Darren May  ----->  In other casual news, I did a roselia raid to complete my daily research task
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm guessing it was not shiny
Darren May  ----->  Nope. Not for me or snookems. Of course he famously got one at the beginning of zapdos day and rubbed it in the rest of the weekend so he’s fine
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Can you give me a berry on blissey in arch?
David Busby  ----->  Pseudo taking gym and I’m almost in range just at light 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Berried 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All
David Busby  ----->  My man
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Spots at prices
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No judgment..... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And I didn't not do this recently... 
Michelle U  ----->  What does the blue shadow behind a friend mean? Does it mean friendship went up that day already?
Blaine, E  ----->  Yes @Michelle U 
Michelle U  ----->  haha yay now i can stop making lists of opened gifts!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. It means you interacted to lvl up frands. The Grey arrow means you sent a gift
Ian Fraser  ----->  Still nothing for me and I become a little more bitter with each passing day. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The arrow is a God send
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  For ipoopy
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I knew I wasn’t the only one making lists @Michelle U!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess you guys are smarter than me. I just spam open. To much work! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Fr @Ian Fraser 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I alternate order of spam opening. One day i spam from top down, the next is bottom up
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It’s for science!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’s not that hard. I just make a note on my phone and when someone opens a gift or I raid/trade with someone I put their name on it.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I spam from top down of frand-ship on gifts. I send at least 50 per day. Open is blind and click
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  My husband says I look like an accountant when I open gifts bc I have my list open on the iPad and open gifts on my phone 😂
Michelle U  ----->  lol! yeah i have a sticky on my laptop that i'll write all the names. i had to present during class and the list was still up �
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You should tell him you are a respected member of a higher society and you are one of the best at it! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Michelle U cant be as bad as the guy who was doing a presentation at a conf a yr ago on his mac(poopy) and his wife kept sending him 'call me' 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He couldn't mute it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  200+ there
Sam Kawell  ----->  Dang. I just basically mooch off of you guys and then send my gifts to whoever didn't send me one that evening
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol it's not mooching when you aint got stops
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like Ashley's lvl up in main group 
Sam Kawell  ----->  You just wait until pokestop submission comes to pogo. Research park don't know what hit it.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Museum now
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ok iv
Cindy R  ----->  Oh my gosh!!  I love yall right now...I didnt know that's what the blue shadow meant!!!   
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I sure wish I had that blue shadow...
Cindy R  ----->  😢
Michelle U  ----->  @Cindy R  I think we are going to become ultra friends! did you want to egg it?
Cindy R  ----->  You can do it whenever.  
Michelle U  ----->  ok. can you send me a gift then �
Cindy R  ----->  Lol, yes. Almost to tallassee and will spin a stop just for you.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Sam Kawell went you the level one collector?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Aren't you....
Sam Kawell  ----->  Perhaps...
Blaine, E  ----->  Also @Sam Kawell I'm going to need less sass from you about naming of my walking buddy 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hey now, at least I gave it a nickname
Sam Kawell  ----->  And noone ever needs less of my sass
Blaine, E  ----->  I mean. "Walk" COULD be a nickname. You dont know my life 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  Changing the subject, I can get two stamps today?
David Busby  ----->  No
David Busby  ----->  Niantic has glitchy code who knew 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It seems somebody needs these lol. I just can't collect.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Dang. I'll definitely trade you my shiny mightyena for that pooch 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Crap, I have to get back to Auburn
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr has stuff too
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Show off lol
Darren May  ----->  Dumb question. How do you know if they’re level 1?
Sam Kawell  ----->  The bar at the top is farthest to the left
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Pokegene says it at the bottom too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The dot
Darren May  ----->  Nice
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea halfway there!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  A whole more month haha
Darren May  ----->  Forgot to share this lucky boi I got last night trading trash for distance with Snookems 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Before i noticed Cindy had to go back to work.
David Busby  ----->  I wonder if 1000 is lucky?
Cindy R  ----->  It pleases me that, that must have been torture all afternoon...bahahaha.... @Daniel R 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Took all day to fix that.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I know we usually get the updates later on iOS but this is getting ridiculous!  It’s usually only a day or two 😕
Cindy R  ----->  That stinks!  🙁
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser you talking to me?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  10 days of playing
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm going to keep track of it and we can use it as an example of how long it takes to get the 30 now with all the empty exp. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  How frequently do you play with jr?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Side by side with my main lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't do quick catch and just throw it. I don't catch everything like I do with one phone either. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He only has 18 friends though. He could level up way faster with more 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes no one wants to b his friend haha
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Ian Fraser Update is here but someone in big group said now he can’t open the app. I’m afraid to do it. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Seems to crash. But uninstalling and reinstalling seems to fix it. https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/9a0rfy/update_is_out_ios/?st=JL8IQMAI&sh=05ef2b09
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell im the perfect casual to figure out how fast you should hit 30!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I don't think you could ever call yourself the perfect casual, but maybe you play your alt as one.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes Im not going out of my way for it. It's just getting drug thru the dirt right now.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr is along for the ride. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm afraid mystastic account is way to casual, doesn't have enough candy to eveolve a Grass type lol.
David Busby  ----->  I’m about to get a new phone I think so I guess my phone now will become an alt phone. Gonna see how long it takes me to get to 30 f2p 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Omg finally. First shiny of event
Darren May  ----->  Who needs shinies when you can get some sweet luckies like these?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ooo dragonite and raikou
Darren May  ----->  That’s a 10 attack dragonite and a 13 attack raikou. Thinking about powering up the raikou anyway.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not that bad at all. Tons of stardust saved. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rai will b the best until zekrom comes (gen5) and it still might b better used as dragon instead of electric. Plus, if zekrom doesn't get WC (or something good) , rai should still b better
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I feel rai is a pretty safe investment 
Sam Kawell  ----->  On my way up to Nashville!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Gonna get me buckets of unowns
Ian Fraser  ----->  If I was back home I probably would drive up too. :( Good luck!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah it's a bit of a drive from auburn...
Cindy R  ----->  So Nashville has unowns?  
Cindy R  ----->  We are going to be a little more casual than normal...we are house shopping so I'm sorry if we are bad friends for a few weeks...lol 
David Busby  ----->  I’d go see if deoredxs neighbors wanna move out lol 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Pretty sure he said it’s for rent. 
Michelle U  ----->  😱so jealous @Sam Kawell is there an event going on there or a nest ? I didn't catch any when I went :( 
David Busby  ----->  Yup there’s an event. Unown and Corsola 
Michelle U  ----->  Auburn needs to get one of these events. Or even Atlanta wouldn't be that bad
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Teddy got a new sweater 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Looking snazzy 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yep. Got all 8 already!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Princess looks jealous. Why would you do that to her?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She doesn't like clothes haha
Cindy R  ----->  They are just too cute!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hatch 5 for chansey
Sam Kawell  ----->  Catch 10 for a Corsela
Ian Fraser  ----->  You get a few ultra friends today @Michelle U ?
Michelle U  ----->  I might have... why you keeping track ? 😝😝
Ian Fraser  ----->  Gotta see who’s winning da race 😝
Darren May  ----->  Got this with the go plus tonight
Amanda  ----->  @Sam Kawell Have you caught a level 1 “S”??
Amanda  ----->  Also, if you have a shiny murkrow, we can trade😁
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Did you catch another shiny Murrow @Amanda ?
Amanda  ----->  No. That’s the only one.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Noooooo, this is the lowest s I got. I actually didn't get a level one of anything...
Sam Kawell  ----->  And as soon as I get a shiny mirkrow, I'll let you know.....
Amanda  ----->  I caught 2 N’s and and I. We’re still here though. Maybe I’ll get an S
Sam Kawell  ----->  I didn't know you guys went!
Sam Kawell  ----->  We were only there for a few hours and decided to not play pogo constantly unfortunately so I only got 32 total
Amanda  ----->  It was a last minute left at 1130 after work this, and driving back tonight because I have to work tomorrow. 
Amanda  ----->  We are either completely casual or completely hard core. It’s crazy downtown 😱
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah it was a really cool atmosphere. And we got to meet someone in the verified level 40 club
David Busby  ----->  Jesus that poke caught blows everyone in auburn out of the water
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Insane
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I met her because we were doing an ursaring raid with her and she was gushing about her obsession with ursaring (she has like 30). But then she saw I was level 40 and asked if I was in the verified level 40 club, so I decided to check her stats. It really showed me to be the casual I am
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So what is the verified level 40 club?
Sam Kawell  ----->  It's just a super exclusive group of pogo trainers. From what I've read, the submission process is pretty insane
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So you have to have at least 350 points on this spreadsheet to apply. I wonder if any of us are even close?  I’m know I’m not!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1z-lvCWQM2UxPKoHbKdceGeYtGXltryXNQ5HpK4WgS1g/htmlview?pli=1
David Busby  ----->  It’s saying I need to request access. Quick breakdown?
David Busby  ----->  I know my battle numbers are similar to hers
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Here’s the link where I got it. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1z-lvCWQM2UxPKoHbKdceGeYtGXltryXNQ5HpK4WgS1g/htmlview?pli=1
Sam Kawell  ----->  That link is making us request access....
David Busby  ----->  Both times
Darren May  ----->  https://www.google.com/amp/s/pokemongohub.net/post/news/discovering-verified-level-40-club-secret-club-worlds-hardcore-players/amp/
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thanks Darren. Apparently copying and pasting isn’t my thing 🤦🏼‍♀️
Darren May  ----->  Not that I would qualify but the actual activities of the club sound boring to me
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well I was at 282. I’m sure all the other level 40s in this group would blow me out of the water. 😂
David Busby  ----->  It won’t let me edit. But I think I’d get close?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Probably. My battles won and raid numbers are really low. 
David Busby  ----->  Idk the only thing that really brings me joy in this game anymore is lowmanning the hell out of raids or boasting about who has the better pokes 
David Busby  ----->  Well that and the people 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Gee thanks for thinking of us 😜
David Busby  ----->  In my defense y’all aren’t “part” of the game
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm just at 286. @Keaton Rhea you need to do it.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well that makes me feel a little better. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Actually it's 289
Sam Kawell  ----->  But still....
Amanda  ----->  @Sam Kawell 😁
Sam Kawell  ----->  Sweet! I'll trade you?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  296 for my casual self
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Uh. You’re not 40 yet and your score is higher than mine. That is sad. The only things you have significantly more than me of is battles, raids, and eggs hatched. You have one more gold gym than I do!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I think their metric is a little flawed. If you specialize in things that most people don't, you're rewarded more heavily. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  The categories definitely need to be weighted on the back end
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think they should be weighted towards non-empty xp (catching and spinning) and gym battling and defending.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can check again in a little bit but i filled it out months ago and qualifed by one point
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The only one I do bad on is eggs and lower raids. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess fisherman and stops as well
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well this was a good end to the weekend
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser pls let me know when you're going to open my gift tomorrow
Ian Fraser  ----->  Will do @Sam Kawell . Do you care if I let you know as well @Amanda ? 
Amanda  ----->  Please😁
Darren May  ----->  Had to wait until I got to work to check but I made the cut. I think
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby 
Sam Kawell  ----->  If you throw a pinap he'll give you extra cookies
David Busby  ----->  Fucking 20 minute checks please kill me now 
David Busby  ----->  Oh and that’s another shift leader who made me do her stuff for her cause she didn’t know how 🙄
Darren May  ----->  She looks pretty grateful though. Does she play pogo?
David Busby  ----->  Oh and that’s another shift leader who made me do her stuff for her cause she didn’t know how 🙄
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Corporate leadership material right there. Somebody get that girl a promotion @David Busby 
David Busby  ----->  Oh next time I need you to get the full line of tickets in that pic @Keaton Rhea 😜
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Will do! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Sam Kawell @Amanda you good if I do it now or would the evening work better? 
David Busby  ----->  Btw super sorry about how long it took you to get your food 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Now works for me
Ian Fraser  ----->  Doing so
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nvm scratch that unless you already popped your egg @Sam Kawell 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No worries David. You guys were swamped 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Sam Kawell @Amanda  Going to open in 10 mins.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I just now opened pogo, but when I tried to put a lucky egg on it brought me back to the map without an egg. Oh well...
Ian Fraser  ----->  Did you lose the egg? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Fortunately not, so that's good
Amanda  ----->  Thanks @Ian Fraser 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I know Jarel has been playing but not on his mystic account apparently. Does he need to be kicked?  
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’d have no second thoughts. Especially of you need the space
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I meant from mystic chat 😂
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Then doubly so. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Infiltrators shall not be tolerated. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m gonna msg him first. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Could it just be an alt that he plays with occasionally?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That’s my guess. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He created an instinct alt which is still lower than his mystic account but it doesn’t look like he’s playing on the mystic one at all. I messaged him. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I still don't get the need to start another account if you don't have a level 40 one. We started our valor account just to knock ourselves out of gyms. But we started huckleberry to help put the smake down on auburn.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You should wait for 40x2 before you make an alt
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My smack down squad is almost done. I wonder if I can do the duo in partly cloudy 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wish ho was here longer
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, 'smack' is inappropriate text in pogo lol. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Top Men. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Joseph Spalding I have opened 20 gifts today, so you might want to open mine
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ve opened my 20 for the day too
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oops. Oh well
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You guys all ok with adding Charner to mystic?
Darren May  ----->  I’m old and casual and don’t know who that is. I just want people to get off my lawn.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yes. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I keep meaning to ask. Taylor beat me to it. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Never met the dude, but I'm sure no one is surprised.
Ian Fraser  ----->  You’re so casual that we won’t ever be best friends at this rate. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sorry that was to @Darren May i had to make sure he hadn’t actually opened my gift before I called him out 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well the criticism wouldn't have been wrong if it was toward me...
Darren May  ----->  Hey the one thing I do still do is open 20 stupid gifts every night before bed. It’s like a terrible job
David Busby  ----->  Darren’s a low maintenance friend. But i think that’s only to his top ten or so 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean at this rate I’ll hit 40 before ever being best friends with anyone so I guess it doesn’t matter that much. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Taylor was just asking me about him
Darren May  ----->  I wonder if anything happens after you become best friends that encourages you to keep sending gifts or will I be able to focus on some of my neglected friends like sparklyblacksun?
David Busby  ----->  Wait you added sparkly black sun?
Darren May  ----->  She added me. I was too nice to ignore her twice
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I really hope it will be with it to be able to trade and the IVs actually be worth keeping.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Me too, Darren
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think it would be cool if the IVs stayed the same once you got to best friends, but there is no way Niantic would do that.
Sam Kawell  ----->  But that doesn't change anything about the uselessness of gifts once you get there...
Darren May  ----->  Maybe better gifts like rares and silver pinaps
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I guess it would help the super casual that do not spin enough stops 
Sam Kawell  ----->  It'll probably be like getting to level 40. A cool accomplishment, but no real rewards
David Busby  ----->  I’m just looking forward to +4 balls. That way I can low man raids with other teams considering two of the people I used to do that with in here moved and another just wants kids off his lawn 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Your right @Darren May I'd rather open 5 with rares instead of 20 and have to trash just to make room to open gifts.
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby Seems like the Uber has been out of service too
David Busby  ----->  Damn called out. Too true tho I’ve been casual
Darren May  ----->  Some guy showed up for the first ho-oh at wilmore on Friday and he looked just like @Sam Kawell from a distance. I was very sad when he got closer
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Sad panda 🐼 
Sam Kawell  ----->  😥
David Busby  ----->  I still look at every white Jeep 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I have done literally four legendary raids since I came up to Huntsville aside from Articuno day
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Sam Kawell The moment midnight rolled by (I’m on EST), Yours was the first gift I opened. 
David Busby  ----->  Who the hell did Catie just add @Ian Fraser 
Darren May  ----->  Is that showerpikachu?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That name looks familiar 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think that is her or her bf
Keaton Rhea  ----->  One of them is shower pika. The other has a similar name
David Busby  ----->  Who the hell is showerpikachu?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Campus haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  dina pikachu
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I definitely remember that all by my self. Zero help
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They are both nice. They did some raids on articuno (zap?) day with Darren and I before it started to rain
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Isn’t Dinapikachu one of her alts too?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Never mind. Reading is fundamental 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She plays both that one and her bf 50/50 I've seen at raids
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So it might appear to be an alt at times. It confsued me for a while
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost If y’all don’t have enough at first pres, I (or Snookems) can be there in 5 minutes 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thanks Darren. I just saw this but we did end up with enough. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wait who did Catie add to what? I haven’t been with her since this morning lol 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @David Busby 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nvm I see it. Idk. I know I’ve seen ShowerPika a lot in gyms starting last semester 
Michelle U  ----->  She works in haley center. Idk which account is hers but one is her bfs
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've asked her multiple times and I think shower is his and dina is hers. But don't quote me on it bc she has corrected me multiple times. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  That’s one very specific nickname. 😂
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Haha 😂 
Blaine, E  ----->  Shots fired 😝
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Haha
Darren May  ----->  This one cracks me up every time 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  True definition of casual.....i can't make it that far.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I could only wish my closest stop was that far away. 😭
David Busby  ----->  Oh god how do you live on the weekends lol 
David Busby  ----->  And has no one ever told c west b that he doesn’t always come off as the most sane individual in chat? Will can be bad sometimes too 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think Amanda kind of tried to tell him that. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Out on the water. Kinda makes up for it a little. @David Busby 
David Busby  ----->  Good fishing?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Been okay for largemouth bass. The bluegill have been awesome this year. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  They’re the best IMO anyways. Especially with the kids
David Busby  ----->  I might be coming out your way this spring then lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Felton T3 hatches 10:27
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr. Is OP
David Busby  ----->  Jr might have more pokes caught than df3
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Took 13 days of real playing to get there 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr goes to timeout on weekends
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Broke 1M exp too
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Jay’s close
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And today it's time to play what Keaton went home from work early to mass produce...... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And guesses? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Jalepeno poppers?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ding ding 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yum!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  What are you putting in them?  Bacon and ground beef?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The healthy ground meat. Sasuge 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Feta, patmeseaon and fresh grated sharp cheddar 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Fancy!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The secret ingredient is metal
Keaton Rhea  ----->  (music not the physical untinsils I used lol) 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I was thinking you added some iron flakes or something
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. Only ferrous metal was added
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I knew what he meant from a previous conversation about cooking 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Don't go spreading my cooking secrets Elizabeth! 
Cindy R  ----->  That looks yummy!
Cindy R  ----->  Fyi....we are still way casual! I am trying to send a few gifts a day.  We put an offer in on a house yesterday so on the edge of our seats waiting to hear back.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ooo I hope you get house! Sounds exciting
Cindy R  ----->  We hope so!  I am in love with it...ps dont tell the seller. LOL
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Wish you the best of luck! We’ve been house shopping in town also, but haven’t had much luck. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like that house! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  One serving 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Now the question is do I drop out of skool now and open a food truck with @David Busby ? Not like I'm graduating in about a yr or anything.. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  How is that a question? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Obviously yes 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby sorry looks like the ? Messed up tag 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Every time I log in to my daughter’s account, the same five or six notifications pop up. Is anybody else having that happen? It’s really weird. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Getting close @Joseph Spalding 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I got stiffed on a ultra frand today, otherwise I’d be at 40
Joseph Spalding  ----->  😢 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh no! 
David Busby  ----->  Shit idk if I’m an eighth of the chef keaton is but you show me how to make it I’ll be in that food truck with you lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Count me in. I can run a cash registers and I know all the till skim tricks... I mean.  Yeah. I can help. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Umm @David Busby dont you work as a line chef? I hope you know as much as me lol. If you b have to Google Alton Brown then you b might as well b dead to me....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If you have to *
Amanda  ----->  Memememememe🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️
Blaine, E  ----->  Congratulations@Joseph Spalding !
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well from browsing through my friends list now, @Blaine, E will be last to 40 in this group. It is a tight race, though.
Blaine, E  ----->  Thanks for pointing that out @Sam Kawell 😅 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I just like to promote (mostly) friendly competition!
Blaine, E  ----->  Well it can get pretty close between@Michelle U  and@Ian Fraser ! They are killing it
Ian Fraser  ----->  Unless I’m able to go hardcore a couple of days and she’s not Michelle is slowly pulling ahead I think. That or her ultra friend supply dries up. 😅
Michelle U  ----->  Another race I didn't know I was in 😛 I think it'll be interesting once we all start getting best friends
Sam Kawell  ----->  Basically it's a popularity contest.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Sam’s just mad he’s missed out on all this sweet, sweet, empty frand XP on the way 40. 😁
Joseph Spalding  ----->  And now I can be mad about it too. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well now I have the moral high ground and I can condescendingly look down at all you plebs with your inferior xp
Joseph Spalding  ----->  [oldman] GET OFF MY LAWN [/oldman]
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Speaking of xp
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Sooooo close to 20mil exactly 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  And 1. 🤦‍♂️ 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Whoa there, for a second you and Darren merged into one person. 
David Busby  ----->  Good eats is my shit man! I can read a recipe and follow one like everyone else but my repertoire isn’t as refined as yours @ keaton
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  This guy is one of the most knowledgeable people in this fb group I’m in. 
David Busby  ----->  Please just give them the gamepress top attacker’s list 
David Busby  ----->  Burn the witch
David Busby  ----->  Oh god I just realized with all these new casuals were gonna have to start making regular jokes about aggron in big chat
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Dat aggron doe
Darren May  ----->  I’m going to power up some raikous today so that should ensure it is the next legendary raid after regi. You are all welcome 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E I guess me eevee names were correct in terms of exp..... 
Blaine, E  ----->  -
Blaine, E  ----->  -_- ** we moved on@Keaton Rhea  �
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess I missed out on all the fun
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Bed time at 8pm will do that
Sam Kawell  ----->  BTW, unown are spawning in Atlanta for dragon con the next four or five days...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I need to find an excuse to go to Atlanta. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think we are gonna have to make that happen @Cindy R 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sorry we had to raid and run @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Did I y'all get a decent one. Mmmkine was for a change.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t check poke genie yet but mine was at least a wonder with 15 defense. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Hot damn my roommate is going to be going to DragonCon...maybe I’ll make a day trip there. Or just give him my log in. He’s a level 23 Valor. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also @Michelle U think of it less at a race and more of a fight to the death to determine who the best PokeTrainer is.😅
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Fight fight! *grabs popcorn*
David Busby  ----->  Hey it’s not a true fight until someone brings out there top screen by cp 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Who wants to catch these pokehands?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think they’re more worried about getting to 40 @David Busby. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Spinda at meditation garden
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr will fight you
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Fite Jay!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looks like a fair fight! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Tldr, use them SD ttar
Darren May  ----->  Dang no breakpoints for raikou after 26.5?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He does but it's small increase. At lvl 40 and it's only for WC lol. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I generally focus on quick move break points. Charge move break points are not as important 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Blaine, E lol
Blaine, E  ----->  🤗
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Y’all are cracking me up with these names. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :(
Blaine, E  ----->  Don't pretend you didn't start this@Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I didn't! I world not do that..... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Would
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is not something a kinda Manta would do.... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  But an actual Manta? Vicious.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Manta helped my gramma cross the street while saving not one, but three kittens from a tree. He’d never do such a thing. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm trying to hang with the cool kids but only some will get it lol.
Blaine, E  ----->  Fits well with Feeby Buffay!@Daniel R 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So does
Cindy R  ----->  Apparently Crap is inappropriate...lol. We watch too much friends.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea they turned the filter back on. Weedle is now inappropriate 
Michelle U  ----->  Omg! I love the names! 😂 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m gonna add Shelley Aistrup to mystic if it’s alright with you all. 
Amanda  ----->  I kind of feel bad it was a Mystic eevee gym, but fr all shiny or bust
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  There was a already a non-shiny jolteon in it when I dropped so I went with it, but I thought the same thing. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh wait, that’s a different one. I’m not in TT. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😂😂
Cindy R  ----->  Anyone else going to Atl?  We are off tomorrow so headed there now. :-)
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Trying to find an excuse to go 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  Think I might be going to the actual con on Saturday..mostly because my roommate already is and unknowns. He’ll catch plenty though for trades no matter what. 
Cindy R  ----->  We plan on catching for a few hours and then head home late tonight.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Opelika Jack's stop is chansey
Cindy R  ----->  Future Umbreon...yes casual status check...Lol
Cindy R  ----->  We have some level 1's if yall want them...I am sure all 3 accts. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Stupid jr.....
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I liked this before I saw the caption. Sorry @Keaton Rhea 😐 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's fine! Its still technically mine
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I’m slackin on Jay’s 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Or weekly chat drama. Its just said I felt the need to scroll back to see what I missed lol. 
David Busby  ----->  Wtf just happened in mystic and who the fuck is mirage 
David Busby  ----->  And wtf happened with west?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think he's back peddling. He said he didn't mean it that way but...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I assume something between him and will.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Also are unown considered a special trade? If so we need to hit our ultra friends daily when we can and if not we still need to meet up with our ultra friends lol. Bag space is in the red.
Darren May  ----->  Same, can’t trade my trash from DC with Snookems fast enough
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Joseph Spalding You good if I open our ultra gift now? 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Gon’ head
Ian Fraser  ----->  Done 
David Busby  ----->  So uh when we gonna kick Jarel from mystic 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I noticed his instinct account leveled up. He never responded to my dm but he logged in and caught something on his mystic account and posted in the group. 
David Busby  ----->  He even has his instinct account listed first 🤦‍♂️
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I would say he needs to go
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I guess this Joseph Scott guy needs to go too?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost next week gonna try to coordinate with darren a few days to trade since it will only allow one per day.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So if your out any morning around 7 am let us know.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m usually still in my pajamas at 7 😜
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You can still drive in pajamas lol.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Is leaving the group and rejoining what the cool kids do these days.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost i added Joseph Scott to Manta Jr and he I lvl 37 Mystic. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Joescotty and numbers was his name. Actually really good catch numbers and walk distance. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The red outline on that screem is red if you are male in game. It's kinda pink if female. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Same sort of color
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But idk why his background is red. He def was Mystic when I added. I can double check later
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ok. Thanks for taking one for the team @Keaton Rhea!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Proof
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Is he the joesia in the main group?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No. He’s Joseph Scott in the main group. 
Phil Pearson  ----->  @Sam Kawell I’ve found some level 1 roos 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Btw DinaPika is Davina Q in big group. Apparently Catie is doing research with her this semester? Anyway that’s why she got added. She’s been in campus gyms forever so 
David Busby  ----->  Joe Scott is joescotty as has been said. He rolls with bigbadbrad but they live in dadeville so don’t come into auburn a lot. Haven’t heard from him or bigbadbrad in a while 
Amanda  ----->  Big bad Brad wasn’t fond of the storm
Amanda  ----->  Left him out of a couple of raids
David Busby  ----->  Ok how long has this been going on?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was wondering when you were going to notice. I named one of my best machamps after you 😜
David Busby  ----->  How long has it been?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Just today
David Busby  ----->  Ummm where’s my time and battery and stuff 
David Busby  ----->  Oh it’s back. That was weird af 
David Busby  ----->  Also I accidentally clicked back on to the screenshot and was trying to click on pogo 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
David Busby  ----->  And just to spam chat late at night @Phil Pearson that stop you sent me was amazing. The box that’s name was think outside 
Phil Pearson  ----->  We have awesome stops here. My fave is sweet mullet bro
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Best stop so far was sent to me from Hawaii......Donky Balls...lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Second wingull jr caught.....
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm not seeing any wingull in general up here...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I saw maybe 15 total from a 30 min trip. But I was just trying to collect gifts
Sam Kawell  ----->  I wonder what people think who don't know you guys that well...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They prob think that Emily girl is a loser.... 
Blaine, E  ----->  I think Emily R is a nice person and you should stop being so mean to her 🤷‍♀️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We all know which one I'm talking about. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Created new poll 'Which Emily are we talking about?': https://s.groupme.com/xtDhog
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hair cut! 
GroupMe  ----->  Poll 'Which Emily are we talking about?' is about to expire
GroupMe  ----->  Poll 'Which Emily are we talking about?' has expired
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Blaine, E is winning the creative battle
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Smoke checked
Blaine, E  ----->  Anything is possible when you have friends and Google to help you 😅😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  Got one!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Two can play this game. @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yummy! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I fried shrimp 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Kaitlin is allergic 😕 I miss shrimp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm sorry about that :/
Sam Kawell  ----->  So what do you think this person's opinion of this art was?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Would somebody look at the website and tell me if my friend code is on there?  I thought I took it off but I just got another random friend request. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Still there @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Boo. Thanks for checking @Ian Fraser. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I got another shiny swablu! 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That moment when you realize you have caught more normal type pokemon than some lvl 40s....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Is that why I've gotten 2 or 3 random. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Cindy R And @Daniel R i definitely can’t get out early this morning but I might be able to tomorrow morning. 
Cindy R  ----->  Ok :-)
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  My husband just laughed at me when I told him I was getting up early tomorrow 😂
Darren May  ----->  This one hurt
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Hate it when that happens. 
Darren May  ----->  @Ian Fraser I realized that I’m going to the beach on Saturday so I can’t do campus moltres day. 🤦‍♂️
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well that sucks. Surely someone else will be here. I’ve got 6 2nd best breakpoint Ttars ready to go so I should only need one more person. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Might get them up to the last breakpoint with dust event this week too! 
Darren May  ----->  Yeah I don’t think I’ll be able to get any raids in, unless snookems or my brothers account improves drastically in the next 5 days
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah Im going to Beach moltres day as well. It's odd how our vacations seem to synch up Darren haha
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Weird, make that a trio of vacations. We’ll be at Great Wolf Lodge for my Son’s birthday. 
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Um what beach?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't remember exact name but it's  of Destin and miramar. One of my friends dad's owns a house out there off of 30A
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It is east of Destin 
Darren May  ----->  Dang, we’re at gulf shores. We could both drive an hour to Pensacola and raid there. (Not really, my wife would kill me)
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was reAlly hoping that would work out for you guys. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My wife would kill me as well
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser if there is not a raid train driving around auburn or Opelika, I might join you. I'd prefer to hit more than just campus, but it looks like most people are going to Columbus or Montgomery...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Not sure what I’m doing yet @Sam Kawell. My daughter wants to go to a thing at the library that starts at 1:30. 🙄 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think everyone is leaving bc its a home game @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah I understand, but I won't be able to travel outside of Opelika
Darren May  ----->  I’m now wondering if I can trade enough vaporeons and gyarados to my family to be able to beat a moltres
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Sam Kawell I can do more than just campus I’ll just be leaving the bookstore at 1pm. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  How much geodude candy you got @Darren May ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've saved a few... Might evo so trash geodude I've saved to make Jr actually helpful
Darren May  ----->  Only 53 🤦‍♂️. I evolved and traded several golems to Snookems to strengthen his team but my youngest son transferred them. 🤦‍♂️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip. Sorry to hear that
David Busby  ----->  Holy cow who’s worse your children or deoredx
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Prob deore
David Busby  ----->  Idk he’s never been a water trainer 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah. But multiple shiny? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It warns you.... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Did he transfer another one?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I thought he posted two
David Busby  ----->  Aron and a sunkern I believe. He didn’t even know he’d transferred the aron til he saw the shiny version in his Pokédex 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh I missed Darren’s comment bout transferring golems. 🤦🏼‍♀️
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Cindy R I’m heading out in a few minutes. Where should I meet you?
Cindy R  ----->  We are coming into Auburn...let me see if we see a good raid. 
Cindy R  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost museum?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sounds good 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Sam Kawell How many do you usually try to hit on bird day? I usually go for 12 but I can increase that number if you want. 

12 would be in no particular order: AISC, Parker, Stadium, Haley, Arena, Cary, Arch, Waterfall, Willmore, Davis, 1865, First Pres. 
Phil Pearson  ----->  You can do 35 if you try hard
Sam Kawell  ----->  And if there is not a home football game....
Sam Kawell  ----->  The more the merrier for me @Ian Fraser but 12 seems sufficient. We might need one more, bc these are my only decent smack down ttars
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’ll ask around. We can bump it up to 13 if we do Prices as well. 
Darren May  ----->  @Ian Fraser You forgot plainsman 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Man, catching a weather boosted second stage gives you over 1100 dust. Bring on the Pidgeottos
David Busby  ----->  1672 with a star piece 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Star pieces are lasting an hour if no one has noticed 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wait, why are you even in Auburn this weekend @Sam Kawell ?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Haha, we're taking my son down to be baptized at our old church. And we decided to go down a day early to see friends and so I could do the raids
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea What are the ttar breakpoints again?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  40....lol...all ttars worth doing should be at 40.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ok @Ian Fraser and @Sam Kawell what is your plan for Saturday?  I think I got out of this book club thing. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  30.5 and 35.5 I think off the top of my head
Keaton Rhea  ----->  For ultra not PC
Ian Fraser  ----->  My idea was start at Haley at one. (I get off the bookstore at that time) Go to WF and basically just spiral around campus ending at the Arch. 
Darren May  ----->  Hmm, based on pokebattler I can duo it (especially with partly cloudy). Can I hobble enough together between the rest of my family to do it?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I may join you guys @Ian Fraser 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm in a similar mindset @Daniel R 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not all 40 yet but at least upper 30s
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser @Elizabeth Kidd Yost that sounds good with me! The three of us should be able to do them in a decent time too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  3 strong accounts of ttar or golem at lvl 30+ should shred moltres. Prob only need 3 of each 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I didn't check poke battler.just guessing. Maybe be on ur 4th poke VS OH
Darren May  ----->  Well it will be one strong account, Snookems ok account and then trash. 
Darren May  ----->  Guess I’ll be prepping snookems account tonight 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok + trash = good enough? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Trash with vap is prob not the worst. Maybe tomorrow I can check to see if garbage like sudwoodo and solrock are legit. Trade a weather boosted over haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have an 1861CP solrock from Sweden if you want it lol @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  I mean if you can’t beat it, it’s not a big deal since I wouldn’t be able to do it otherwise. Also assuming my wife will let us go play
Darren May  ----->  *we* can’t beat it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is a bold prediction there.... 
David Busby  ----->  @Darren May If you have the extra device I could always give you df3s login 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Take wife's phone? That way she can't call you? Win win? 
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby I may take you up on that. We should be able to use my mom or dad’s phone. Also my wife just mentioned the event in the car without any prompting from me so there may be a chance
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's a miracle @Darren May !
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Spots at Felton 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Phil Pearson I'd appreciate a gift if you have one now that I actually have egg spots
Ian Fraser  ----->  Pretty sure you’re about 12 hours too late....
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea he deleted the app this morning. :(
Sam Kawell  ----->  Crap.
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser just powered up another tyranitar so moltres my team is pretty good now.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If they are not smack down are they still next best in the line up? 
David Busby  ----->  Nope golem then Alolan golem
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->   Fine then lol. What's the preferred golem move set?
David Busby  ----->  Rock throw stone edge. Here’s the thing though the trio is pretty stupidly easy apparently. So you Cindy and huckleberry should be able to do it no problem 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Fire blast or crunch to go with smack down?
David Busby  ----->  Stone edge...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Stone edge
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Stone edge
David Busby  ----->  Moltres is double weak to rock. So basically even terrible pokes with rock moves will perform near the same level of kyogre
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I now consider myself informed lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Gonna trade huckle berry some golems and see about that trio 
David Busby  ----->  https://pokemongo.gamepress.gg/raid-boss-counter/moltres-raid-counter-guide
David Busby  ----->  If y’all are using golems and smack down ttars he could get away with using kyogre and even bite stone edge ttars I’d think 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Mine should be good.And huckleberry has 3 matching smack downs
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Why in the world did that add a link?
David Busby  ----->  Yea y’all should be killing it in a trio easy 
Phil Pearson  ----->  Had to leave the bigger groups so I won’t get a thousand messages when I open GroupMe. I’ll rejoin when I’m back from the field in four months 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Good luck and be safe.
Darren May  ----->  I guess since me and @Keaton Rhea will be out of town this weekend there will be no Mystic Mew Bros photo-op with @Sam Kawell @David Busby for Celebi? Meaning I can go ahead and claim mine?
Sam Kawell  ----->  I was going to take sad picture at Davis with mine...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Looks like chemtrails or aliens @Sam Kawell 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Congrats @Michelle U 
Michelle U  ----->  Thanks😊
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Trying to b all sneaky about it too
Michelle U  ----->  Lol how?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You didn't post it anywhere. I had to see it from the friends menu.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wish that I could see from the main window if there was an unopened gift already. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just a heads up. Jin is trying to lvl slimjin up and has been taking gyms. He is sending me the spots and I'm calling them out in Mystic. I'm not driving around town during the day lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought that seemed odd for you 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Seeing as how I raid with slimjin a bunch, I figured it's good to help him get better haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't even call out campus gyms, Sam Harris, Boykin, or zion when I take them anymore 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I was wondering why you called out Cary and then it looked like a Jin alt was the only one in the gym lol 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m not sure if campus is going to work for me on Saturday. I walked from Cary to downtown today and had horrible reception. I even guessed Keven’s WiFi password and it wasn’t any better. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Reception will be touch and go for sure. We’ll have AU WiFi at at least 4 of the gyms. But if you want to join up with a group that will definitely have better reception please do...I’m just stuck on campus. :(
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Does the bookstore open back up after the game?
Cindy R  ----->  I think we are gonna be hit or miss on raids.  We have a nephews birthday party that afternoon.   We have somehow missed everyone of these events lol 
Ian Fraser  ----->  No we’re only open till 6:30. 9am-6:30pm @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Matt Inger  ----->  I think I’m going to do Opelika and avoid the crowd 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So why do have to stay on campus @Ian Fraser ?
Ian Fraser  ----->  We don’t necessarily I just won’t have a car there and don’t get off till actually 1pm. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well if we want to do Opelika, I might be able to pick you up. But I'll have to talk to the wife.
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean if someone wants to pick me up, drive me to raids, and then drop me off somewhere near the Walmart on S College that’s totally fine too lol, I just wasn’t going to ask anyone to go through all that trouble. 
Blaine, E  ----->  It's probably easier to pick you up than to deal with campus traffic/ cell service. If Sam can't I can talk to Emily about what we are doing to see if that's possible too
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I'll keep you posted. Do you Opelika peeps know a good raiding route? I'd love to hit as many as possible, but I really don't know the pogo scene there.
Darren May  ----->  Other Saturday problem (my Saturday problem): one of my 3 smackdown ttars has terrible ivs, like 8/5/4. Would it be crazy to trade it to Snookems, who has none, just for the iv reroll?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay that would be awesome either way. 😂 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  There are some people working on an Opelika route. 
David Busby  ----->  Does snookems have any 2016 pokes and less than 10 luckies...
Ian Fraser  ----->  Uhhhh there’s a gym map I can pull up and look at tomorrow. 
David Busby  ----->  Also I’d be way more down to do random auburn and opelika gyms and I can Uber 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May it really shouldn't make much of a difference... #ivsareoverrated
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay so definite plan is to abandon campus and someone will pick me up at 1? 
David Busby  ----->  How many people we gonna have? And I think so
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  This is a possible order West came up with. Something like 1.Mary Olive Thomas. 2.TigerTown. 3.Fake Starbucks 3&4. Two churches in front of Walmart. 5. Masonic Temple 6. Mount Transfiguration 7. Cemetery 8. Church on other side of cemetery 9-14. Downtown gyms.  15. Covered bridge 16. Church on the way to southern union 17. Sportplex 18. Rotary Park 19.?church on 459?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think the plan now is to start at goal post instead of Mary Olive
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell That was quick 
David Busby  ----->  Or we could just do museum to Felton five then turn to library and opelika or swing around auburn 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That would be better @David Busby 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Crap. I just realized I have three egg spots open. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Michelle U have you played at all since getting to level 39?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, @Keaton Rhea props  on the throwback nickname
Michelle U  ----->  @Sam Kawell not at all � I took a study break to catch celebi and hit 39 and havent touched it since lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well that stinks. It's almost as if you're in pharmacy school or something
Michelle U  ----->  If you couldn't tell by my lack of gift variety ... 😉
Darren May  ----->  Didn’t spend near as much time planning this photo
Darren May  ----->  Nice!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wow. Top teir IVs you got there.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Good think IVs are overrated amirite? 🤔
Ian Fraser  ----->  *thing
Sam Kawell  ----->  Pretty sure that's absurd
Cindy R  ----->  Spinda
Blaine, E  ----->  I know that feeling @Darren May 😂
Darren May  ----->  So last moltres question I swear. What’s better a bite/stone edge ttar, high level solrock, or a water type (kyogre, Gary)?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think some in this group live for these questions. Sometimes I ask just to help @Keaton Rhea not focus on work lol.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Kyogre and solrock and smack down\fire blast ttar are better than bite\stone edge ttar. And Gary just isn't that good...
Darren May  ----->  Flashback to when Gary got waterfall and was the best water type for a month. RIP 
Ian Fraser  ----->  You take that back.. :( RIP Gary, best water Pokémon in the game for one week. :(
Ian Fraser  ----->  It wasn’t even a month 
Darren May  ----->  I think it was close to a month. It got waterfall in December and then kyogre came out in January 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Your spreadsheets are great but to really expand your fanbase you need a second set that you could call the “snookems sheet” or the “casual calculator” that is designed for trainers without optimum counters and mostly have non-powered up raid bosses etc
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I could prob start doing that. I tend to optimize things too much... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry if I came off as an ass. I labeled it as trash bc I wouldn't invest in any of those (except kyogre which I listed at raid boss lvl) 
Darren May  ----->  I didn’t take it that way. I was laughing about the level 40 b/se ttar as if Snookems would have a powered up anything. Or intentionally powered up anything 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The ttar was on the original one I did so I just left it
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So, Pete told me this morning that his goal is for his alt to have more hours defending the library than Leslie has. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is rough. I thought this Leslie thing was over
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Nope. And it won’t be until she publicly admits that the library is not her gym. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So dumb
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Will backed up for a little while, but then he got mad that he got kicked out after a few minutes and he’s back at it. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  *backed off
Darren May  ----->  I don’t really care anymore. I’m just tired of the constant status updates in the mystic chat
Ian Fraser  ----->  lol that’s so childish 
Blaine, E  ----->  Man the person taking that picture did a fantastic job! What a shot! 👍 @Keaton Rhea 
Ian Fraser  ----->  The library thing not Manta 😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Matt and I were battling with her one day (she was in her office) and after about 20 minutes she came out and casually said she was walking to the poke stop to catch something. That’s the day I stopped caring. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah I guess it's a lost cause
Ian Fraser  ----->  New stop!
Ian Fraser  ----->  No new gym at S College though, RIP. :(
Ian Fraser  ----->  *S College Starbucks 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Where is that stop?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Corner of Heisman Dr and Donahue. Right beside Plainsman. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Hey @Sam Kawell are you interested in any of these?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Or these? I also have a magmar 
Darren May  ----->  I mean if you put in a 10cp Pokémon as the first one in a gym, how long should you expect to hold the gym?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  0000000 time
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't have many of those, but since I'm not in Auburn much and when I do, I rarely have much free time, it's probably not worth saving...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We might have a chance tomorrow. I’ll hang on to them until then just in case. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Testing something...does anyone else see it???
David Busby  ----->  One alarm isn’t set for the weekend?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It doesn't appear tobshiw on a screen shot. But on a white screen not pokemon....it looks like a burn in at the bottom. It's the tap button for doing battles.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, burn ins don't show on screenshots
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That should be a badge lol. How many gym battles it takes to burn the button to  your screen lol.
David Busby  ----->  Ok so what’s going on for us raiding tomorrow? Is the group me, Ian, Elizabeth and Sam? And we joining west or what 
Darren May  ----->  Imma need that df3 login, please.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't know. It seemed to me that @Elizabeth Kidd Yost knew about a group that was being planned in the Opelika GM, so if they want to go hard we might as well join them.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I kinda like your plan better @David Busby 
Sam Kawell  ----->  That would definitely be more mobile...
David Busby  ----->  What was my plan lol? Just museum and then felton and whatever we can hit in between? Then
Sam Kawell  ----->  And Hunter would like to join as well
Ian Fraser  ----->  Felton won’t have one btw. Right? 
David Busby  ----->  Idk I’m down with whatever I just need to know who’s in the group. I can dejunkify my car and hold 3 easily
David Busby  ----->  Felton won’t but I’m so used to calling it Felton five 
David Busby  ----->  Also yes was planning on dming hunter or just putting plans in mystic 
David Busby  ----->  I feel bad leaving west out but I’m not down with starting at goal post into opelika especially if I’m picking Ian up 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well my car should be available (if necessary), but I'd prefer not to use it. What if we post a message in mystic with our plans (with a deadline to respond) and then settle the car situation tomorrow morning
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I probably need to drive myself in case I have to bail. 
David Busby  ----->  Sam you can ride too if you want 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think West is fine with his plan and I think there’s a big group planning to do it with him. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Lemme get back to you on picking me up...gotta see if someone else is. 

Also just so you’re aware I will 100% be unable to look at my phone from 8:50am-1. Game days are pretty crazy. 
David Busby  ----->  Is there? Cause I’d feel bad if he got fucked if he’s counting on us. I know he’s counting on Matt
David Busby  ----->  Ian just take my phone number 2052308776
Sam Kawell  ----->  So is the only difference that they aren't doing the Felton 5?
David Busby  ----->  No he wants to do basically opelika only 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He’s been posting in the Opelika group. I think DeoreDX and StarlyteGlimmer are joining him too. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And it looks like Wicky Ticky is joining him too. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Does anyone know who all West is expecting from us, because I'd hate to drop that crucial people aren't coming on him tomorrow morning. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  But moltres isn't really that hard, though....
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I told him I might join them but didn’t commit. I’ll dm him if you want. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Surely four of them can beat it right? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  DeoreDX has three accounts and West has two so they should be good. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Moltres is stupid easy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If you just have one carry account of smack down ttar
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Using avg accounts, 3 man is pretty easy. 4 man is LeBron slam dunk
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  They’ve also got the black suns so they should be good 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  Then we can totally it one by ourselves with no guilt
David Busby  ----->  So the plan is to have myself and Ian at museum as soon as physically possible. If y’all wanna start up a few before we get there I’ll understand cause I usually don’t wait 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Cool. I'll be there.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't know who mentioned the possibility of Parker spoofing bc of getting sketchy gifts, but I now remember him saying that a friend was going to New Zealand and he asked her to play his account.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  But it looks like he’s trying to play here @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  You guys. My Alma Mater, Samford University is up 26-21 on Florida State with 8 minutes left in the 4th...
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ended up losing thanks to four interceptions, but we were leading until 4 minutes left in the 4th
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea @Darren May how many were you guys able to do?
Darren May  ----->  Got 3 in. We didn’t make it to the beach until 3. It was pretty easy even with my brother and mom’s accounts which were primarily their level 15 encounters like raikou and zapdos. Didn’t even have to use df3. I think me and snookems would have been really close to a duo
Darren May  ----->  My mom got the shiny of course
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I did zero; however, Emily was nice enough to be able to get 6 in for me. Even with awful signal in AU
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I missed 6 or 7 that our group did in Auburn bc I had no service. Once we got to Opelika I was fine.  Stupid AT&T 
Sam Kawell  ----->  You probably could have. @Ian Fraser and I duod one with 60 second remaining
Sam Kawell  ----->  Or as my phone wanted to say, 60 sexiness remaining
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost I'll be at felton early but if you think about me I need to be part of 2 waves. Cindy had family plans today.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ok. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Looks like Leslie will be a little late and David mIght be late so we should be able to get a second wave. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And I’m probably going to be a few minutes late as well. I’m seriously annoyed right now. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'll save my account for last so I can do it with whomever 
David Busby  ----->  Ok I’m otw and logging into df3 so I’ll save me for last
David Busby  ----->  @Joseph Spalding Is someone doing yours?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Not that i know of
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We got ya
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I saw that. I just got home from driving most of the morning and was surprised after I checked. Thank yall. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  David gets all the credit 
David Busby  ----->  Thank Adam I was busy scrambling for Jin
David Busby  ----->  @Ian Fraser You didn’t happen to see what Elizabeth and I did with our sunglasses did you? Lol
David Busby  ----->  Or @Sam Kawell saw maybe 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I found mine. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don’t remember seeing you walking up with sunglasses on actually. @David Busby 
David Busby  ----->  I had them at some point and I remember them putting them on top of my cup holder next to your backpack. It’s possible they fell in their?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh. These @David Busby ? I thought they were Catie’s lol
David Busby  ----->  Yup lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well that didn’t take long. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You ever wonder if he doesn't eat right and his sugar drops or something lol. Or maybe he does drink and text who knows 
David Busby  ----->  What do you think my messages after 10 are lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Finnaly 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just had a thought so evily funny I couldn't post in mystic. To an start a valor alt naming it something pete and fill the library. I womder if that's what it feels like to be storm lol.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Just wasted 5 TMs trying to get another Dragonite to have the best dragon move with no success.
Outrageous
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Is that still available?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So I read your statement wrong. Are you trying to get outrage?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Also is anyone else bothered after all the work to get mewtoo now every level 5 account will have one?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Eh. We knew it would happen eventually.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I was trying to make a frustrating situation punny
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  ????? A level 36 with a million star dust?????
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I don't think I'll ever hold out for a million.
David Busby  ----->  Adriel 2.0
David Busby  ----->  Holds onto dust and doesn’t know what to power up. Uses recommended or top cp in every case I’d bet
David Busby  ----->  @Daniel R Thoughts? Only non 98+ are dragon 96 and smack ttars
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think Jr. is distracting you @Keaton Rhea. No gift from you today and you haven’t opened mine. 😮 
David Busby  ----->  Don’t open. I wanna be top in someone other than my casual friend 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He’s probably in bed already. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry out of town :(
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Is that how many candies and dust you spent on those?
David Busby  ----->  How much I’m spending rn to get to 40
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You got some serious work to do lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  But I just might have more level 40s in general 
David Busby  ----->  Oh this is the post dust event extravaganza 
David Busby  ----->  That’s just what I’m doing. I think I had 35 level 40s already
Sam Kawell  ----->  You guys are making it stupid hard to input my silph road research for the day. Ugghhhh
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  My last level 40 count was over 70
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm sure you've got me beat on 98s and perfect at the top 
David Busby  ----->  Not until rn I bet lol. I’m 600k dust in. Still got 1.2 mill left and a lot of pokes to max 😍
David Busby  ----->  I’ll leave this up to you and Cindy, hundo muk or hundo Alolan sandshrew 
David Busby  ----->  Also 98 Groudon or 98 rhydon 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I already reached my limit @Keaton Rhea 😫 
Blaine, E  ----->  He is at his limit too@Elizabeth Kidd Yost , sorry!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @David Busby might get his wish. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I literally finished opening gifts and then saw that I had one from him. Would have opened his first if I’d realized!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That groudon sits on top 3 kind of nice.
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea do you have anything to show everyone?
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Michelle U I'll send you a gift tomorrow if you could let me know when you'll be opening it
Ian Fraser  ----->  Aw is she about to get another 100k? 😅
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @David Busby I'm not sure if I have a level 40 muk, gonna have to look now.
David Busby  ----->  I can’t get him to 40 without rares 😢 so who wants a muk for distance lol 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  But it'll ruin that IV lol
David Busby  ----->  No I need those three candy for every grimer/muk I trade 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Not sure all my dust gets used wisely 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost sorry I messed up. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That's just said @David Busby 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @David Busby my sad low tec list. And I only have 68 level 40s.
David Busby  ----->  Please don’t do the dunsparce.... don’t be Parker 
Cindy R  ----->  I will never get all these to the top...lol https://v.groupme.com/39263023/2018-09-11T04:29:13Z/269e3a9a.640x360r.mp4
Cindy R  ----->  I don't know why it squished it..lol
David Busby  ----->  New top screen makes me happy
Cindy R  ----->  I have to work on some of my legendary pokes..
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Michelle U just sent you a gift. I'll probly not be checking my phone for the next couple hours, but just let me know when you're about to open it so I can throw a lucky egg on when I open the game.
Sam Kawell  ----->  So I think I caught the rarest Pokemon I've ever seen today. For perspective, the average weight of a Rattata is 3.5 kg. Using stats, I found that this one is 8.4 standard deviations away from average. So using statistics, if I caught on average 20 Rattata per  day, Iwould only find a Rattata this big once every TRILLION YEARS!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You have to much dust......and time on your hands lol 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Lol, there is always time for recreational mathematics
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. Math is fun. 
David Busby  ----->  Wtf dude you ok? I don’t think your allowed up this late 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So pokestop submissions are now a thing for a limited amount of users
Sam Kawell  ----->  Unfortunately I'm not one of those users....
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  How do you know if you are?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well if you live in Brazil or S Korea is the first check lol

Darren May  ----->  @David Busby Dang, wanted to try the rhydon duo
David Busby  ----->  Oh we’d have duoed easy. Thing was dead at 80s left and elooop didn’t even lead with ogres. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ill duo it with you @Darren May 
David Busby  ----->  I can come by with df3 and if you’ve got a bunch of maxed ogres or Gary’s we could do it 
David Busby  ----->  I can be on standby with df3
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Im just getting out of lab and can be over there shortly 
Darren May  ----->  Ok I’ll head over @Joseph Spalding 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  9
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Carroll said I was the LeBron James of pokemon. Haha. I'll take it 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Sam Kawell getting some of that sweet TSR karma I see 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Lol, I guess people like to show off their big rats
David Busby  ----->  Wait I need to find this and find sams reddit account 
David Busby  ----->  Brb
Ian Fraser  ----->  84 karma and all TSR comments. Not near as entertaining as mine. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Prepare to be disappointed. I only have a Reddit for pogo
David Busby  ----->  And yours is....
David Busby  ----->  Fuck I suck at Reddit’s search engine but I know you posted on that one thread about a groupme for auburn
David Busby  ----->  Now was that on pokemongo or tsr
Ian Fraser  ----->  Neither lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  I had 20 karma before today if that says anything
Ian Fraser  ----->  Mine’s not too hard to find, but I’m not gonna just do all the work for ya. 
David Busby  ----->  I swear if it’s Athenian whatever that’s just no fun
Ian Fraser  ----->  It’s not! There used to be a comment linking my ign to my reddit account but I think I deleted that long enough ago that google search has overridden it. 
David Busby  ----->  I really really wanna tag him on tsr but I also have no clue what kind of incriminating evidence is on my account...
Sam Kawell  ----->  What's the big deal about finding someone's Reddit account?
David Busby  ----->  People post embarrassing shit about themselves or post in the “wrong” subreddits
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also anonymity usually provides a way for people to be more immediately honest. For instance we’re all friends but you probably don’t know much about my: political views, argumentative style, non PoGo hobbies (like I have any), a few things about my uhm personal life (someone asked a question I thought I could be helpful and answer), some more bleh parts of my past.

Now for me personally I’ve made sure to never put something on the internet I don’t want being associated with my actual name, but some people cross that line and thus want their real name and online persona separated entirely. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ah, makes sense
David Busby  ----->  You glossed over the rampant amount of fetish subreddits lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Isn’t that what reddit was founded for?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Of course.!How could I forget those?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Something had to take over for “Dear Penthouse”
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sooooo apparently that’s how obsessed Valor is with the library. 
David Busby  ----->  If only I gave a fuck I’d make it fun for them but I’m now on the opposite side of town now 
David Busby  ----->  Wills out here throwing stones in a glass house like Pete is any better than Leslie 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Eh not worth fighting about, Valor gonna Valor. I just thought it was hilarious Robert letting us know exactly how obsessed they are with it. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Like we didn’t already know 🙄
Matt Inger  ----->  Jin had six of his accounts in there this afternoon
Sam Kawell  ----->  Such a team player
Darren May  ----->  I mean that is the valor m.o.
Darren May  ----->  On the other hand I can do without the library gym updates if Leslie is not going to actively defend it with good defenders. Or be willing to battle through berrying
Ian Fraser  ----->  That’s when it’s no longer worth is @David Busby 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Plz don’t 
David Busby  ----->  But he’s just wrong
David Busby  ----->  Oh god I didn’t realize he’s that far into the rabbit hole 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I know. But (a) we’re not experts in the field and (b) you can’t argue against that wall easily 
Darren May  ----->  I’m not sure if this is common knowledge or not but there is a split second after pressing the final send/open gift button (right as the gift starts to move) where you can press X and skip the animation. Really saves some time for opening gifts since you don’t have to look at the different items received and see the friendship level increase
David Busby  ----->  Bro I’ve been abusing tf out of that at 1155 lol 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Haha. Me too. 
Darren May  ----->  Cool. I discovered it last night by accident but I wasn’t sure if other people knew about it since I have most of the chats muted most of the time
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Daniel R I opened huckleberry’s gift on accident. I’ve been avoiding in case you wanted to lucky egg it. Sorry 😐 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I did not know about that trick @Darren May. Thanks for sharing!
David Busby  ----->  I don’t really know what you have to tap but I just tap the gift really fast until I get to the end 🤷‍♂️
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  True Pokemon challenge ride across camous and museum without spinning a stop lol.
Matt Inger  ----->  You tap where the x was after you hit open.  The x disappears but it will still close the animation when you tap there.  I saw it on one of the YouTube videos for saving time that west posted.   
Darren May  ----->  All these people trying to coordinate raids this morning do realize that better raids are coming this afternoon right? Also I’ve convinced that dragonite will be a tier 4 boss so I can bring back my walrein team and name it “Spheal Team Six”.
David Busby  ----->  But they still don’t have regirock and everyone needs a regirock right?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Someone I just raided with doesn’t have regirock
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't have a regirock.....
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell I have 2 so I got your back
Sam Kawell  ----->  My brother also has few, but thanks
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Darren May do have have 6 at the top?
Darren May  ----->  Walreins? No they are all in the 30ish range and we’re good enough for rayquaza. Although I’m sure @Keaton Rhea will point out that rayquaza, dragonite and salamence are better depending on circumstance (in my dreamworld where dragonite is a raid boss)
David Busby  ----->  Articuno!
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby Ain’t nobody got dust for that!
David Busby  ----->  Well I did. Then a hundo muk, some dragons and ttars happened 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I do but I also already have a bunch of the birds from each of the bird days and the Regi at Parker happened to be convenient. 
Darren May  ----->  I have a level 40 nidoking so I’m not going to judge anyone’s power up choices (other than Parker’s) but I’ll just hold out for mamoswine 
Ian Fraser  ----->  He’s baaaaacccckkkkkkk
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So wait.. Is mewtwo like legit going to b a normal raid? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Starting the 20th, yes. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yup. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  We have no clue what’s happening with EX raids 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Damn that is crazy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Deoxys? 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Deoxys is my guess
Joseph Spalding  ----->  But this is Niantic we’re talking about, so who knows. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Main question is will we not have an ex raid push until after the 20th? 
Darren May  ----->  I was hoping they would just get rid of ex raids altogether but I guess not with the new share a pass feature in the code
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah I'm kinda tired of ex raids. There are no other gen 3 options I can think of. Gen 4 has a bunch of possible ones. 9 legendary and 4 mythic (technically 5 I guess if you count the baby) 
Sam Kawell  ----->  If you want to create much violent conversation make a post about how you think Deoxys will\wont be the next EX raid boss on TSR.
Sam Kawell  ----->  And I don't have much of a problem with EX raids. The sharing passes feature makes them much more excessible, and they weren't super exclusive currently. I just like the excitement they bring.
David Busby  ----->  Ex raids are cool but I remember not being able to get my first mewtwo because I couldn’t get a pass even though I had Felton gold and raided the shit out of it
David Busby  ----->  And for the places that don’t have ex gyms because no one was doing openstreetmaps or whatever it is is super shitty 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, but hopefully pass sharing will help out those places somewhat. Also, there are signs in the APK of a little marker for ex eligible gyms in game like they mark sponsored gyms now. Who knows when that will be implemented, but maybe cycling to another Pokemon in ex raids will include a upgrade of the system. Bc they've basically done nothing with it since beta testing
David Busby  ----->  “Beta testing”
Sam Kawell  ----->  Lol, yeah
Joseph Spalding  ----->  We’ve been beta testing pogo for Niantic since day one. [c-suite] Think of the dev time/money saved by passing the “experience” down to the user and then integrating that back in to the company. It’ll be great. Trust us. [/c-suite]
Ian Fraser  ----->  Unpaid quality assurance is the best quality assurance. 
Darren May  ----->  These all showed up after 3. Wonder if they are Regis or birds. Stay tuned 
David Busby  ----->  Regis 
David Busby  ----->  Wait showed up after 3??
Darren May  ----->  Maybe not
Darren May  ----->  Yes
David Busby  ----->  Hour and a half timers 
David Busby  ----->  Maybe 15 minute eggs 
Darren May  ----->  Also I guess the nests changed? Samford lawn appears to be shroomish 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I think they rotated out Machamp and Ttar....
....
....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So us it safe to open gifts for regional eggs?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ninatic says yes. No screenshots yet on TSR yet so I’d err on the side of caution 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nvm Ttar and Machamp still in thank God. Also T1 Dratini
Sam Kawell  ----->  I wouldn't have minded rotating out ttar for Dragonite personally
Darren May  ----->  I hate this game. Didn’t even realize until I got back to my desk 
Darren May  ----->  My fault I guess for not knowing the cp for a hundo 
Ian Fraser  ----->  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/9flwn7/ultra_bonus_event_fresh_batch_of_regional_eggs/?st=JM1387WL&sh=00fd1dd1

REGIONALS ARE LIVE. However they’re rare. 
David Busby  ----->  Gave me a 98
David Busby  ----->  Didn’t even need the rays and flipped em to flying for nothing 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I was about to post how awesome this event is.....
Darren May  ----->  I’m still @David Busby level salty about the 100 moltres from yesterday. Thought about quitting but I convinced myself to keep playing for the event but if I don’t hatch a mine and kanga...
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm so sorry Darren. Does this help any?
Darren May  ----->  Not really but I don’t mind other (non-casual) players getting good pokes.  It is a combination of the fact that it was my first 100 legendary encounter and I blew it and also I was in a bad mood the rest of the day and barely able to function at work, which seems a tad bit unhealthy 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May i have a mime with your name on it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dare I post Sam Harris stats in Mystic chat.... 
Darren May  ----->  If it will make her quit posting about the library all the time
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No don’t 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Fine fine
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll post it here instead. She got me beat on battles lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If I hadn’t been hunting for an elusive chansey I would have told her not to post that. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  At this point I just want whatever is gonna to be good for PoGoDramaCoin. She obviously won’t leave well enough alone and neither with Valor. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I just don’t want to create tension within mystic and I think Keaton posting that would do it. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll keep my mouth shut then
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I got chu beat in battles too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mine is more of a berry feeding post than anything. I always have too many berries
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, there is less competition for that gym.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also want a yr total of defended 
Sam Kawell  ----->  And Leslie really doesn't berry the museum at all
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If battles from previous gym system counted, then it would b more competitive. I tore down tier 10 towers regularly solo at Sam Harris 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well that wouldn't be quite fair bc Davis wasn't a gym until late July last year
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ah yes true I forgot. Rip bike shop
Sam Kawell  ----->  One of the best days for me personally
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  2nd time the bike shop came up today. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Poor un finished gold lol
Darren May  ----->  Man, the fun of sneaking out of a staff meeting to drop in wilmore when the gyms first went live
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Never did much there but I have the badge. 
David Busby  ----->  Wait so did Leslie post her library gym pic in big group?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes 🙄. I was driving and hunting a chansey and wasn’t able to tell her not to. 
David Busby  ----->  Jesus
Joseph Spalding  ----->  🤦‍♂️ 
Cindy R  ----->  She can hang up ever keeping the library...lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  Did I miss a big chat purge? I thought there were over 500 people in there recently?
David Busby  ----->  Oh ye. Blake did purge anyone who hadn’t spoken in chat in 30 days. Taylor and Jenny got the axe I believe
Sam Kawell  ----->  Lol. Good for him
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ross purged anyone who didn’t have their trainer level on their name. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Haha, I approve of that even more
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Can anybody using an android phone tell me how to turn off sms delivery in GroupMe?  I’m trying help a noob but I’ve got iOS. 
Darren May  ----->  In other news...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nice! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May Wilmore T5 in about 10 mins. I can prob do it if it's not garbage rocks
Keaton Rhea  ----->  A group looking to do it at 1
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or shortly after
Joseph Spalding  ----->  You can steal mine if you need @Keaton Rhea 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I have a class at 1 unfortunately. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think we can beat it with who we have but I'll take it if you want
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  What is it @Keaton Rhea 
Amanda  ----->  Parked in cubby by construction. Adam and I can do it at 1
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I can’t get there by 1
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Art
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They are looking to do at 110
Ian Fraser  ----->  FYI Elizabeth, Bob, and I four manned a Articuno this morning with 60ish seconds left. And Elizabeth and I were the only ones with SD/SE. 
Amanda  ----->  We’re gonna go ahead and go with the  kids.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Definitely trioable I think. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Don’t worry about me. I’ll try to hit some more tomorrow. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  If you can wait, i get out of class in broun at 1:50 @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No @Joseph Spalding i really need to go home and clean or wash dishes or something. 😕
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We've been trioing them but when ttars are not boosted you defiantly need a second best team set up. Going in the second round with what's recommended cuts it way to  close.
Darren May  ----->  So 1:55 wilmore @Joseph Spalding?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yessir 
Darren May  ----->  Got it. Just got out of my meeting 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May ditto manky pharm building 
Darren May  ----->  Thanks. I caught one yesterday at Haley. Should have posted an update 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  27 days of playing. Jr OP
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess it time to drop out of skewl and professionally lvl pogo accounts. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And open a restaurant with David 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Congrats on the perfect @Elizabeth Kidd Yost about time,a non casual got one lol.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Did you see West got a perfect shiny on his son’s account 😩
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I was just fine not knowing that lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wild chansey waterfall
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Daniel R I'll be opening yours and Ross's gifts tomorrow to get to Ultra. Do you care when I do it?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Yes please. Still trying to make that double 40. Don t want @Keaton Rhea to be disappointed lol.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Would 7 am work for you?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Perfect I'll already be trying to raid about that time anyway.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Do you think they’ll beat the regirock?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope. 5 for garbage rocks is not easy
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m assuming the others are pretty low level too. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I assume they ain't got this either... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Has no one posted yet that Beldum community is probably confirmed for October?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  'probably' doesn't sound good
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've not read jack

Ian Fraser  ----->  2 hours old. Someone found a picture url that’s legit. Also Metor Mash got put in the game couple months ago 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If meta doesn't get meat or mash... Then I'm going to b sad
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Shiny meta is legit too
Blaine, E  ----->  Do we know when the next community day is?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just a guess but I think it is on Lee's site 
Darren May  ----->  Ugh but what about shadow claw or lick gengar?
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Blaine, E 
Blaine, E  ----->  Thanks
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip SC gengar 
Sam Kawell  ----->  As awesome as he is now, SC Gengar will become significantly less meta after Mewtwo month if they cycle him out of ex raids though.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But gengar is so old skool! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gimme them old boys
Darren May  ----->  Um some people also got a push notification for deoxys ex raids
Darren May  ----->  Hype!!
Amanda  ----->  Ya’ll go like Ken’s perfect poliwag in Mystic chat.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Nope lol
Amanda  ----->  It’s cute.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If I  don't have one then casuals shouldn't have it either lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  here here@Daniel R 
Cindy R  ----->  Hey why am I the only one who liked it @Amanda LOL
Amanda  ----->  I liked it😁
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I only looked at the avatar at first and thought this was @David Busby. Pretty sure it looks just like his. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May I've already opened 20 today, so I sent you a gift
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I liked the poliwag too Cindy
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell I already opened 20 too
Sam Kawell  ----->  That gif is amazing. And unfortunately this means you get passed by Elizabeth... So sad.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Hey now!  What’s sad about that? 😉
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Speaking of friend levels, I always feel bad when someone tells me I’m at the top of their friend list and they’re not at the top of mine. 
Darren May  ----->  Hey I found out tonight I’m in @Amanda ‘s top 3 and I always felt like she never opens my gifts. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm guessing @Keaton Rhea is #1 on everyone in this group?
Amanda  ----->  I know I’m not in anyone but Adam’s top 3 . Lol. It’s only because he still traded after I’d fall asleep on gift opening 😔 
Amanda  ----->  I’m friend casual 🤷🏻‍♀️
Darren May  ----->  The coordination for best friends is going to be crazy. I want to at least wait and do 5 at a time for a cool million
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  
Well, Taylor showed me tonight that I’m in his top 3 and he is below you on my list @Amanda 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You are #20
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May I was just thinking today that I never open gifts from you. You almost always open mine. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost aside from Keaton, I think you are the best at giving gifts. It's quite nice
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I always try to send you one Sam since I know you don’t get to spin many stops. 
Cindy R  ----->  Is it bad that Sharon is my #2. 😬
Cindy R  ----->  @Sam Kawell I try to hit you...I finally got you in my top 20!
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm actually doing much better bc my strategy was to befriend a bunch of casuals who send me gifts pretty regularly. 
Cindy R  ----->  Awww just caught this baby in the backyard...makes for easy candy!
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost When friendship first came out I would send a gift to everyone on my list everyday. It didn’t take long for me to burn out. Now I just open 20 at night before bed and pick 10 lucky people to get a gift from me, usually the people in my top 15-20 that haven’t sent me a gift.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have too many friends and I try to send too many gifts everyday. I should probably just focus on my top until we become besties and then focus on others. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Keaton is number 2 on my list. Right ahead of Catie 😅
David Busby  ----->  I’m number five on Amanda and semi impressed 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So @Ian Fraser if Keaton is # 2 and Katie  is #3, who the heck is #1?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Blaine lol. She was the first to respond when friends got announced. I think Catie was actually my second friend added she’s just a bad gift opener 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Daniel R I'll be opening your gift in a minute
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Y is Leslie wanting to trade with me? I don't have anything to trade right now 
Cindy R  ----->  I think she asks everybody!
Darren May  ----->  You said it yourself dude about raids. She wants the social interaction and you offered delibirds to beary 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s why
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip. That's what I get for being nice
Joseph Spalding  ----->  No good deed goes unpunished 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean I'll give her a mime but I'm not giving her my larv and drat re rolls. They would b wasted
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If anybody wants to try for a better articuno I have a few that I will trade for distance. I NEED those cuno candies! 
Darren May  ----->  I will trade whatever but you can only do 1 per day right?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes legendary and shiny count as a special trade even if you have them already
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just won't b as bad stardust wise
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Should only be 1600 at ultra right?
Darren May  ----->  Yeah just tedious for you since you can only do 1.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have a few magnet, machop, and geodude still left over from Stockholm.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And a bad 1401CP raikou from my stamps that I caught over there
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I used up almost all of my 450 rares powering up my lucky ogre and ray so it’s gonna be a minute before I get that guy to 40. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wish I had 450 rares :/
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  None of raikou are very good so I might have to take you up on that one!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thus is where I would put my rares... If I had any! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The only good rai I got was on jr lol
Darren May  ----->  I have plenty of trash still from DC that ensures the 3 candies but that is a 2 trade scenario. One person does the legendary while the other does the trash for distance. Then reverse the next day.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes that was what I was thinking. Such a pain. Wish it was 7 special trades per week. Resets sun night or something 
Darren May  ----->  Luckily I have a mime now so that doesn’t count as a special trade. I have a couple of egg hatches from Portland that should give us some sweet distance 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Kaitlin got a 98% raikou 😩
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Same as jr! 98 missing HP I think
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I have a ton of cuno to trade you @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Michelle U I need a gift from you or if you open mine please  let me know we should hit ultra friends.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ah so she does have more lined up. :( 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip Ian 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Michelle is ruthless 
David Busby  ----->  Ian how far away are you?
David Busby  ----->  I’m 2 mill away from 40x2 but I’m casual now 
Ian Fraser  ----->  A looooong way. Her and I are both about to hit 1mill into 39.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've gone casual since 40x2. Only about to hour 44M 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  About to hit *
Cindy R  ----->  Oh, I may need to pop a few eggs...I am just shy of 43M. Lol @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Uh oh... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  How many bests you got lined up?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well I'm just hoping to join the club.....soon...lol
Cindy R  ----->  10 in the next 15 days...some will start hitting in the next week. Then an additional 8 within 30 days. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Too many. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Don't make me start mass evo again
Cindy R  ----->  You stop that...LOL. I am too lazy for that these days....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only way I can keep up
Michelle U  ----->  @Daniel R are you able to lucky egg now? I can do it now if you're ready
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Go for it I'm running one now
Darren May  ----->  @Daniel R @Cindy R thanks for waiting. Sorry I had to raid and run but the children were getting restless 
Cindy R  ----->  See...slacker...lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Thanks @Michelle U ultra with you poped right after raid and that did it.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yay! Daniel made it
GroupMe  ----->  Daniel R changed name to Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yay! 
David Busby  ----->  Who?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Blaine
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You beat me b4 I could type 'some loser' 
Blaine, E  ----->  I see what my friendship means to you @Keaton Rhea 😑
Keaton Rhea  ----->  200k of empty exp? 
David Busby  ----->  Are you feeling bet-Rhea-d?
Blaine, E  ----->  He's making me c-Rhea-zy
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Blaine’s puns are best puns!
Ian Fraser  ----->  So I was messing with Blaine about walking distance and we actually compared ours and found out something kinda funny. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hey that is where mine is! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea, if you add both of our totals together you get KarKar’s total distance. 😂 
Ian Fraser  ----->  But yea, literally a kilometer (and a bit) difference. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Together you beat KarKar 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Barely. KarKar OP
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Trying out new things. Any suggestions? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yes. Crawdaunt. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well lvl 40, best frands, AND foggy... It hits 22DPS. But still worse than all other dark listed above in fog
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh God I hadn’t even thought of using Crawdaunt. Yessssss
David Busby  ----->  Wait can you reliably duo with best friend without weather boost 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  With an army of SC gengar maybe... But the whole rejoining is going the make it prob not possible
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lvl 40 gengar only lives like 4 or so hits from confusion too
David Busby  ----->  I was thinking 1-2 suicide leads then shadow ball mewtwo? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  In fog, bests, you can prob do it easy with ttar
David Busby  ----->  Oh yea that’s been done before
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm down to try. I've got 2 SC powered up 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It would prob have to be psycho cut HB/FB
David Busby  ----->  Won’t have the option to have HB
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm not 100% they remove both moves. This is Niantic, they can do odd things. But if they do then it might b possible VS FB bc of immunity. But I doubt gengar will survive anyways 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Does mewtoo start after 3 today?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yep!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And it is trioable with ttar BC. Correct?
David Busby  ----->  Easy trio with ttars over 30
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Without boosted ttar?
David Busby  ----->  Gonna need to put some dust in em for sure. The 4 man is stupid easy 
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Late to the party but where are the bite/crunch Garys and the double dark arcanines? 😂
David Busby  ----->  #askingforsnookems
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dumpster
Darren May  ----->  Snookems actually has a ton of ttars. None powered up though
Darren May  ----->  Thinking about maxing one of my hundo houndoor/houndooms
David Busby  ----->  21 I think was the old breakpoint before friendship. So if you’re ultra with snookems I’d bet he’s hitting breakpoints without any dust 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll look in a sec for real tho
Darren May  ----->  What about this feisty boi? My leadoff man
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lvl 40 B/C gyrados 16DPS. lvl 39.5 S/C arcanine 15.7DPS. Lvl 39.5 SC/DP mew 15.4DPS
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So yes, Dumpster trash. Lvl 20 DT/O rayray 14.9DPS. Lvl 25 rayray 16.1DPS. Lvl 20 PC/SB mewtwo 16.3DPS....
Darren May  ----->  Man the one time this week there is a raid at Davis I can do, there is zero interest. I unmuted big chat and everything
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May ill do fire ckn on main 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Need dat sunburnt ckn
David Busby  ----->  If you need me I can come out 
Darren May  ----->  Can we trio a boosted one?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes ez
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Boosted only gives it better atk. Health stays the same
David Busby  ----->  125?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can do 125
Darren May  ----->  Good with me
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ll do it if I can park
Darren May  ----->  Put your flashers on. That solves everything 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’d do it but I’m at home on kid duty today. 
David Busby  ----->  Looks like it’s gonna be flashers on for me lol 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May  if your still looking for them birds, Haley in like 10mins
Darren May  ----->  Dang I just told someone I was going to be in the office so they could bring something by for me to sign 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just lock office door and put a sticky note that says "out for extra important meeting at Haley center" 
Darren May  ----->  Haha, weather changed but I could try it at 3ish if it went back to sunny
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Ooo wilmore has an egg now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If we go right at 3 I can do it. I've got class at 330
Darren May  ----->  Ok, I’ve signed the proposals so I can do Haley or wilmore 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's a zap
Keaton Rhea  ----->  For Wilmore 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I already did fire ckn at haley
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You want zap @Darren May ?
Darren May  ----->  That’s good with me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've got one more coming so we should b good
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And no it's not jr
Darren May  ----->  Ok, right now?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wait do you need art? Parker about to hatch
Darren May  ----->  I’d rather do wilmore since it’s a shorter walk
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But that poke distance medal
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip its a zap too. I'm free whenever for Wilmore 
Darren May  ----->  Ok I’ll head over now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Omw
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got a legit shiny! Thanks Blaine!!! 
Blaine, E  ----->  I liked his original name better "phlegmanta" �
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Fixed
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So do I take it to 40 and wait for them to give me an option to get frenzy plant or say SB is good enough? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Fun fact: I don't know if anyone has played around with new dps calculations with Mewtwo, but with ice beam he does basically the same dps as dragons against rayquaza\dragonite\salamencs counter.
David Busby  ----->  If he got avalanche I heard only mamoswine would be better 
David Busby  ----->  Assuming they give mamoswine a not shit moveset 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well even with ice beam only the wet paper towel Jinx is better.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm prob gonna keep all my SB mewtwo and just use others for candy. I can really think of any up coming T5 that it would b useful against off top of head. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Probably wait for Frenzy Plant @Keaton Rhea 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Man oh man the chaos of raid chatter lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We're are going to do which ever ones we can get to if anyone wants to join as Cindy gets off about 430.
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I think this thing has buffed stats 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mewtwo? 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It wouldn’t surprise me one bit @David Busby 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hmmm
David Busby  ----->  Cp is like 60k 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok they def buffed the shit out of mewtwo
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It rekkt my mewtwo
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @David Busby did you already do IM?
David Busby  ----->  Yea I did it with brad and several others but I’m at arch now. Should I go to bridge?
Cindy R  ----->  Yea, I think everyone is done with arch 
David Busby  ----->  I’m gonna knock out arch with some storm. Y’all mind waiting for a few?
Cindy R  ----->  Yea we can wait
David Busby  ----->  I’ll be there in 2 if lights permit 
Darren May  ----->  @Matt Inger Where you at duck samford tonight? Saw someone who looked like you while I was at the playground but I’ve been wrong before so I never acknowledge people in public.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That awkward don't make eye contact situations... 
Matt Inger  ----->  Yeah, I’m out here watching some baseball.  
Matt Inger  ----->  @Darren May I saw you and the family but didn’t want to be the weird Pokémon guy saying hi.  
Darren May  ----->  Haha that would have been fine. I once accosted @Sam Kawell at a restaurant in destin but his hair is unmistakable 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm happy :) 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, rip stardust
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ok. I feel like the “weird Pokémon guy” every time I see Snookems with your wife @Darren May. He always says hi and I’m like “does she think it’s weird that some adult she doesn’t know is saying hi to her kid”?
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I think your ok...lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I'm catching up in stardust!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So after hitting 40 x 2 yesterday. 3 raids before work and 5 this afternoon.....so much for being casual lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sam is gonna pass me :(
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm reckless with stardust
Sam Kawell  ----->  And you gain it at an absurd rate.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  *casual rate
Ian Fraser  ----->  This might be a pretty stupid question but does Mewtwo being buffed effect breakpoints at all? 
David Busby  ----->  Nope. Defense not affected only hp. But I bow down before manta and sams superior knowledge 
David Busby  ----->  Just affects ttw
Keaton Rhea  ----->  T2w is big one. My trainers to win is wrong o
Ian Fraser  ----->  Gotcha. Soooo my B/C Ttar should be at 35, si? What’s the quick and dirty break point for SB Mewtwo? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  BP is same little Ian. Y ttar not max already? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  KarKar mad
Ian Fraser  ----->  Cause B/C Ttar only good against Mewtwo. Ask me about Machamps and that’s a different  story lol 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This but not sure if it is exact. Blaine fucked it up.... So I'm not sure now 
David Busby  ----->  Oh wait should my next poke be hundo scizor? 
David Busby  ----->  Got the hundo pinsir 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No David 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Hmmm. I got a hundo scizor that now needs to be taken to the top. 
David Busby  ----->  Brb Keaton liked it 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Bad reader of chart
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :(
Blaine, E  ----->  Wait wait wait. What did I f*** up?
David Busby  ----->  Butttt the low man unique poke trio is calling my name
David Busby  ----->  Also hundo absol when I get candy 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t have a ttar at all for the first few mewtwo raids so I powered up my pin sir and scizor. I don’t think I ever got them to 40 though cause I finally got some ttars. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Idk but I blame you
David Busby  ----->  And i have a hundo houndoom...
David Busby  ----->  My reasoning is it made the list!
David Busby  ----->  Therefore max
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If not max, give it axe
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ooh. He even has the right movest, no tms needed. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He needs a name change. 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pls new name! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  His new name should be Cash Money
Joseph Spalding  ----->  In due time, M’lady. I needs inspiration. 
David Busby  ----->  Scizor first cause of focus blast?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I like it. @Ian Fraser 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Henceforth, thou shalt be known as...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :( he bad dmg. Pls done use
David Busby  ----->  Need focus blast team tho
David Busby  ----->  Gengar, 2x mewtwo, pinsir then I got two slots to fill. Dragons are second team 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  How bout dis scary boi?
David Busby  ----->  Send scyther candy pls 
Ian Fraser  ----->  You’ve always got rares...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh! I think I just decided what I’m going to my dust on. I’ve been waiting....
Joseph Spalding  ----->  You know what must be done. 2 da 🔝🔝⬆️
Ian Fraser  ----->  I wouldn’t evolve that yet though @Elizabeth Kidd Yost .. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You still think they’re going to bring sc back?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Too likely they’ll bring back a legacy move at some point, or introduce a better move imo. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m really not sure, but I wouldn’t be shocked. 
David Busby  ----->  BOW DOWN BEFORE THE SALTY CHOP
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Did you do shiftry? I have a weather boosted hundo
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Do shifty? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Shiftry
Darren May  ----->  Sure, I saw him on an infographic once but it may have been goofy weather only
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ohhhhh for chart. I can double check. His atk is kinda pitiful tho but prob around houndoom and absol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't think he was among the generalist attackers like Ray ray
Darren May  ----->  I thought houndoom was good, generally speaking 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Started bring my B/C Ttars up this morning...only to realize I have next to no Ttar candy after bringing my lower level SD/SE up. Can KarKar plz send candies?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Same
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve got some that I need to reroll
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol... KatKar is poor too 
Darren May  ----->  When you wanna try and spice things up but you run out of funds
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I missed what these are for?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yaaaaaaas. Another added to the ranks. You’re in good company @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  Also this guy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Houdoom is not terrible @Darren May . Just squishy. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, shiftry is down right terrible. Lvl 39 is only 17DPS
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Revised. @Blaine, E look correct now? 
Blaine, E  ----->  I approve
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I approximated the # of trainers based on it having same atk, but 50% more HP
David Busby  ----->  Dang so 4 really good accounts. Sounds about right.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wouldn't say it's 100% exact but I think it is close to what to expect. He has so much HP and can easily wipe time with high atk
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Break points are all correct 
David Busby  ----->  Rip for da casuals
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah. Should I even post this in Mystic? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess it will b ignored anyways
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  There could be one person in mystic group to absorb your poke battle knowledge. I just don't have the dust to keep up lol......yet.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So I should power this guy up? And does sableeye ever come into play.
Darren May  ----->  Dang, I think I’m almost non-casual again. Raid at Felton has me wanting @David Busby to fire up the Uber. Provided we weren’t raiding with the casuals
David Busby  ----->  The Uber might be running later but not til the afternoon 
Cindy R  ----->  @David Busby we are gonna pass through Auburn,  want to meet up for a trade?  

We can do 3 trades today if anyone else wants an unown.
David Busby  ----->  I’m currently otw to museum to but sure 
Cindy R  ----->  Ok, will let you know as we get closer to see where you are.  We thought it would be a quick car wash, but its busy..lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All then out of town losers here
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, it makes me sad inside that Jr. Is stronger than most of the low lvls in main grewp. Too many upper 20s and lower 30s
David Busby  ----->  Same with df3
Cindy R  ----->  You should see huckleberrys lineup... makes me jelly!
David Busby  ----->  What kills me is they’ll say they’re plus one and only have like a level 20
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr gotta be getting on par with DF3 now lol. No good legendary outside of rai. But he got some stuff
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I say play 0.5 if I say anything
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And VS birds it was 1. 0 VS casuals bc of my golem
David Busby  ----->  I mean df3 just ttars, some rays/latios and fighting types 
David Busby  ----->  Oh and ogres 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t mention Kaitlin’s account if I’m using it 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr ain't got any. I might trade them over
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Kaitlin is pretty cute when she is trying to get GPS signal. Walking all over haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She is very lax, then it's all MOM ! I'm not in 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  She’s a mess. Once I get my new phone, she can use my old one for pogo. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I really hate being “That person” who makes everybody back out for her kid. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  A cute mess! I hope our kids are that good! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't care if it is for a kid. That is part of the game. Blame Niantic 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh she has you fooled!  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Our kids still have too much fur.... Waiting on monies to do it right 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Wait til you’re ready for sure. Having kids changes everything. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes for sure. We using that calculator and waiting for the nuke button press
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't make enough now in skewl to do it now. Otherwise it would of happened long ago
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Carroll bread winner
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But that is not surprising 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I realize dating doesn't really count, but we have been together 10 yrs in Feb. I just wish she would come home from bham. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I wondered if she was still gone 😉
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This is what we are doing
Cindy R  ----->  @David Busby you still at museum?
David Busby  ----->  Otw to Felton
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've put zero candy into ttar... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ha ha. I have put dust/candy into my sd ttars which is why I don’t have the candy to get the second one to 35. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My sad mu2 line up 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sad?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. Not all the mu2 are lvl 40
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And only 1 lvl 40 SC gengar with 15 akt
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Atk
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My other is only lvl 30 with 14 atk
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Is fc better than bug bite for Pinsir? Was trying to tm to fc but it just keeps going back and forth between bug bite and rock smash. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well I don’t have a sc gengar at all. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Just a haunted 😫
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Haunter 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Bug bite better
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh good. Your spreadsheet has fc so I was worried 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I thought big bite was legacy.. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry. I guess FC is legacy
Cindy R  ----->  @David Busby you gonna do eagle statue?
David Busby  ----->  I’m otw to eagle now if you wanna do it 
David Busby  ----->  Can have another level 35 mystic with me. Pzeroin
David Busby  ----->  Also fucking big group is impossible to coordinate a raid in 
Cindy R  ----->  Ok see you in a few
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It’s not bad during the morning and early afternoon hours, but man, after 5 o’clock it’s a goat rodeo. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You done after Eagle statue @David Busby ?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Sigh. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I was not as lucky with my roommate as David. :( 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm sure the smoker does just fine @Keaton Rhea but not tonight 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll take half! As in half the food
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looks yummy
David Busby  ----->  I’m not picky or greedy. Just a few bites please!
Cindy R  ----->  Head on to tallassee...there is plenty!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Interested... But old and tired 
Darren May  ----->  Wow
Ian Fraser  ----->  ⬆️🔝
Darren May  ----->  Only 90s kids will get this
Sam Kawell  ----->  What if I'm a 90s kid and don't get it...
Sam Kawell  ----->  I know is already talked about, but read this post! This nutto thing is pretty interesting
https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/9hxlio/shut_down_everything_travelers_a_new_pokemon/?utm_source=reddit-android
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell Not a smashing pumpkins fan?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Mayonnaise 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I guess not...
Darren May  ----->  Billy Corgan was/is the lead singer and he wore this shirt that said “zero” during all their shows. Also have a song named zero
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ah. Learn something new every day
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We caught one earlier and it turned into dito. It didn't give a shadow of itself.
Cindy R  ----->  At publix...all dittos.  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Tomorrow’s the day!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm ready! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :) 
Ian Fraser  ----->  (:
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I saw you @Ian Fraser a dumps like a truck. Couldn't get stalker Pic sadly
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Uber drove to fast
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😋 My mouth is watering just thinking about those dumplings 🥟 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Those dumps were dang good. Got some bubble tea too. :) 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Did you take an Uber to the game or something? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Back from tailgate. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We dont go to games. Just tailgates
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The pork belly buns are amazing and the bao is really good too. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Probably the way to do it. Games are a nightmare sea of people. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Catie got some of those and I had a bite! They were good! They didn’t have any bao though. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby @Elizabeth Kidd Yost pls coordinate tomorrow gifts! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Of course! I think he’s working again tomorrow 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can wait and not do anything until night. Just open app then egg then close like I did today
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea We also hit best friends tomorrow but I was considering holding the gift for a few days so I can open multiple best friend gifts at the same time. If that’s ok with you
David Busby  ----->  Lol I’m like five days away with keaton. I think he hit the sauce a little hard
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mm sauce
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Here you @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ooo beautiful!
Ian Fraser  ----->  What happens when I trade with people vs what they get. 😐😐😐
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yay! 
Cindy R  ----->  @Ian Fraser that's how it works for us too..LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R 
Cindy R  ----->  You have surged ahead...hopefully I can catch up some as I start hitting best friends.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I should have 4 best frands.... But I'll take 3 for now
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Would I of been the first? @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  Yes. Of course I realized that if we do any raids together in the next few days it won’t matter and we’ll level up anyway
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean you could raid with just jr if you saving them eggs lol. As long as I'm first then I don't care! (but not really bc that is selfish) 
Darren May  ----->  I don’t have any real strategy other than I thought it would be cool to get 1 million xp from on egg. Learned yesterday that Leslie is ahead of me in xp but I’m not sure if that is motivating me or not
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Umm you gotta race her! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Would be a good thing to watch! 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost where did you get that one? Looks like you load it and walk away
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Internet. Masterbuilt electric da bomb 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ours came from Sam’s. 
Amanda  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Imma need you to slow down please....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  #Keaton_is_casual
Amanda  ----->  Casually trying to pass me...
Amanda  ----->  I’m going to petition Niantic to remove the library gym...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm fine with that. I already got gold
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I don’t have gold there, and I still approve this message. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I hate that it has caused such discord in our pogo community 🙁
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Should I add this Madeline chick to mystic so she doesn’t make our gyms a target?
Amanda  ----->  She was at one point
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought so but she’s not now. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  She’s already added and left when she left the country for a bit. I can’t add her due to that. She has to rejoin herself 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I sent her a dm. 
Darren May  ----->  I think removing the library gym would make things worse, but everyone knows I would love no more library updates
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean I don’t think we should actually try to get any gym removed but jeez it’s temping sometimes...
Darren May  ----->  Fun fact: Leslie has over 10k battles won and 50k Pokémon caught. She should be able to take or defend the gym if she really wanted to. She has just never met any resistance there before and now it’s inconvenient. I don’t see the difference between the library gym and trying to take and hold something at the museum or central campus
Ian Fraser  ----->  Here’s the difference 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes, but I think it’s not just about the gym. She thought Pete was her friend and now she is finding out that he’s not. Plus, most of us are not really helping her with  the library so she feels abandoned by her team. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  But that’s the thing, we did try and help for a while there.
Amanda  ----->  I’m not really going to try and remove it. Just so many updates. 
Amanda  ----->  Also it’s one of the farthest gyms from campus and not in a dense gym area like museum.
Cindy R  ----->  She just needs to suck it up and admit defeat.  If she just leaves it alone for a few weeks maybe they will move on. 
Darren May  ----->  I’m just glad I don’t sit on a gym at work or I’d be petty af 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The library is close to my house so I used to be able to depend on it for coins. Not so much anymore. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't even read much in the Mystic chat anymore. Got what I need here
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also did some checking. I should have 16 best friends in 17 days assuming I don't mess up anything. 
Amanda  ----->  You got this😁
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So Keaton now that we’re besties does that mean I never have to send/open another gift from you?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Speaking of barely keeping a gym on campus. 7 fkn minutes. At least Gertrude is hurtin feelins...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost you can do what ever you want! Send me gifts if you want; however, I'm going to be focusing on getting more best frands
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So I might not open yours and I don't want alolan eggs at all
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Me too!
Darren May  ----->  Hey future best friend @Keaton Rhea, want to do this davis mewtwo?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was discussing that with Emily now. That or parker
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I can do either or both
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Spots at parker btw
Ian Fraser  ----->  What’s time does Davis hatch? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  1040
Keaton Rhea  ----->  For Davis 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I might be able to do that. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Can we do Davis at 11?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I can swing that
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Anyone up for a b2b davis+parker?
Darren May  ----->  I can do that 
Darren May  ----->  I meant I could do davis at 11. Not sure about b2b
Ian Fraser  ----->  I can probably do that. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can do b2b
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Im in 4 b2b
Ian Fraser  ----->  I could probably do b2b as well assuming I make Davis 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Did @Cindy R say give up....LOL......we didn't give up....get 3 phones start a librarian team and put the smack down on that gym......or don't and let's not hear about it lol.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  As you can tell, neither of those are an option for leslie. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m going to try my hardest to get to Davis at 11. 
Amanda  ----->  I’ll be at Davis too.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->   Which stop @joe?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Chilled Watertower. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Behind Foy beeside Willmore @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost You walking over to Davis? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Any one still on campus up for Parker? @Joseph Spalding @Ian Fraser @Darren May ?
David Busby  ----->  I can do Parker if Felton or eagle falls through
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Im down. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I have a class at 3, but im free till then
Darren May  ----->  Can’t make Parker 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Not on campus anymore sorry @Keaton Rhea :(
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It has been done @Darren May @David Busby @Keaton Rhea 
David Busby  ----->  I just can’t pump rares into him lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I beg to differ!
Darren May  ----->  @Joseph Spalding Right behind you. Mine isn’t a hundo though
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Be still my heart. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So does it keep track of friendship after best? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or is list populated at random? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  ???
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've not enteracted with Sam since best, so he is at bottom. I did with everyone else today
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's same order after app restart too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Both Pete and Darren happened today so they are same lvl, assuming alphabet order there. I've done plenty of raids with Blaine after and I think two with Elizabeth 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell you have this with your brothers? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  David and just became bfs today so he is below you on my list.  David and Matt used to flip back and forth on mine depending on who I interacted with first that day. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm guessing you keep lvling up frandship behind the sceen
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I saw a silph road post today saying that it keeps track after best friends. But I don't get to best friends with one of them until tomorrow 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I expected it to go to alphabetical order, but it appears not
Keaton Rhea  ----->  New frandship lvl pls! 3 more months total for 250k empty exp
Sam Kawell  ----->  Haha. It's just like gym points
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't think Sam Harris will ever leave my top gyms. I wonder if top frand will change... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  If they add more gyms levels and don’t retroactively apply it I’m gonna be a little salty...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gold and silver version (crystal) . Rubby sapphire (emerald). Diamond pearl (platinum). Black and white (and 2).etc
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Slow roll it out
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Fire station, Bowden and TC all T5 have raids I believe 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Use huckleberry instead of Cindy! Cant let her get too much exp lol
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea not nice!!  Lol

Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean he is not going to do that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I need an advange tho
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Do you want to me to let you know before Jr and I hit ultra tomorrow, or is he just getting dragged along?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes pls tell me @Ian Fraser !
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr has eggs to waste. He got lvled up so fast lol
Blaine, E  ----->  PSA: @Ian Fraser  is a bad influence (in general) but more so under the influence of alcohol 😂 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Y’all I’m so bad. All the gyms around the museum were blue so I went to the library to complete my quests. 😈
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr gets all the good stuff...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sam got a better lucky tho. He just doesn't know it yet. I'll let him share it
Darren May  ----->  I know @David Busby must be incredibly busy since someone added people to the mystic chat and he didn’t exterminate them with extreme prejudice 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr OP
Sam Kawell  ----->  Check out this beaut complements of Keaton!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Far too busy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That girls face. Deer in headlights 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Poor thing!
Darren May  ----->  Hey girl you know about Duguno?
David Busby  ----->  You are all dead to me 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That duguno remark tho...
David Busby  ----->  @Ian Fraser You make it before the monsoon?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yep, just. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  A lot of drowned students in broun right now. Squeaky shoes all over. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  To me her face says.....but I don't play pokemon go and I have no idea what your talking about.
David Busby  ----->  God I look terrible in profile. And I need a haircut bad
David Busby  ----->  Semi tempted to put west in his place
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Seems like he was just trying to be helpful. He has mentioned that he thinks there is another mystic chat but he thinks Leslie is in it. 
Darren May  ----->  Could also be his weird sense of humor 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Can I send this to juicebox? Or did you already take care of it: Hey!  Just an fyi We usually let the group admins add new people to mystic once they’ve met them and seen them doing work around town. 
David Busby  ----->  As I said to west at this point I’ve stopped caring. Especially if y’all don’t care I don’t 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I care. I just don’t want you to be mean about it. 
Amanda  ----->  Nobody has stopped caring about who is added in Mystic chat. We want them to be Mystic. We just don’t want to be assholes. We agreed that admins add. Please drink some happy juice.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He might need to wait on the happy juice until he is home for the night 😉
Amanda  ----->  There’s our David😁 I’ve actually raided with them intermittently. They’re from out of town though. I had told them that the Mystic chat wouldn’t be useful to them....🤷🏻‍♀️
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’s Robert’s fault. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Michelle U you right on pace with @Joseph Spalding !
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I may or may not of gone thru half my frands list looking at pokes caught... 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You checking to see if anyone is ahead of your 80 000 plus lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Need a chat to convert battles won to pokes I could have been catching instead.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I found only two @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Guess who 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Probably Cindy and Amanda 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I haven't checked but I drive so I'm probably short lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope surprisly. Cindy is second closest to me. She is like 1k behind jazzy. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She had 74k I believe 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Neither of them are mystic
Sam Kawell  ----->  So Deoxys' stats just got added to the game and we have a new definition of glass cannon. Deoxys Attack has an def stat of 86 and an attack stat of an absurd 414!!!!!
Sam Kawell  ----->  In comparison, the previous attack stat leader was Mewtwo with 300.
Sam Kawell  ----->  So Deoxys will top basically all dps lists even though he is absurdly glassy
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->   Oh ya Sharon 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Matt D?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Will he ever b viable for raids?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope. Think mustang. And other has a bike. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Pseudo 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sounds like it might be an OK gym battler
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes Anthony's main is at 84k
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The other person has over 100k
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Daniel already guessed Sharon
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sabi?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Parker
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I don't think so. His base HP is 100 and def is even worse than I said at 46. So far worse than Jynx at 130 HP and 182 Def.
Ian Fraser  ----->  I would be shocked if Parker has most than Pseduo. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I missed Daniel s post. It's Sharon 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Parker doesn't have jack. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Cb Collins might b high but I don't know how much he plays anymore. Chase wasn't even frands with him
Darren May  ----->  Interrupting to say “screw cbcollins”
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell what about as a gym sweeper? I'm guessing it won't b good VS bliss but VS trash?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t even know who cbcollins is. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've only met cb Collins and Haley once and they wouldn't even talk to me. It was literally just me, chase and them at the raid 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We talked ttar counters b4 raid and he looked at me like I was an idiot. Then we started lobby, and he did a double glance at me and his phone
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So yeah I agree with Darren 
Matt Inger  ----->  So how many has Sharon caught?
Amanda  ----->  @Matt Inger What’s your friend code again for Adam?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think 102k according to chase. We were in lab doing work and I had one headphone in and I may of heard wrong. But I think that is right 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😮
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Is that face bc I was doing work? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And chase just confirmed 102k
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No bc of how many pokes she’s caught 
Matt Inger  ----->  0393 2693 3055
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She got it hard. She got 40 b4 raids
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hit it hard***
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My plebs self was only lvl 38 then
Matt Inger  ----->  I used to see her around all the time
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She is still active. But more so Opelika
Joseph Spalding  ----->  😮 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I was just catching up. I think jazzy had Collins and Haley doing he grunt work trying to keep us out of gyms......i think they grew to hate us...and never spoke that I can remember lol.
Darren May  ----->  MRW I tell people to open their gifts for ultra friends whenever but they wait several days and I open the app to 3 new ultra friends at the same time.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby we hit best today
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And @Joseph Spalding and @Matt Inger we hit best tomorrow 
David Busby  ----->  At work all day. Coordinate with Jin or someone who has my account otherwise rip 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yay empty exp
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby We actually could have been best friends yesterday. I’ll just wait until you tell me you are able to play. Might even be able to line it up  with some other people 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May can you tell where I was? 
Darren May  ----->  Yes, I was hoping you would drop in Davis as you made your rounds. I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve seen you walking by through my window. Not that I’m a creeper or anything 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I missed the berries on Davis :/
Keaton Rhea  ----->  One of Carroll's best friends (known each other since kindergarten) works in cater. She sees me all the time too. So I don't think you are a creeper Darren
Michelle U  ----->  we creep on keaton all the time from the pharm building too. hes hard to miss in that bright orange shirt �
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hey I almost never wear orange! 
Amanda  ----->  Did anyone in here get goalpost and want an invite to Felton for an invite to goalpost?
Amanda  ----->  ...if you don’t have someone who didn’t get a pass to give it to
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m waiting to hear from David whether he got a pass or not. If he did I was planning to give one to Tom. Unless someone invited him already. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I didn't get a pass...
Ian Fraser  ----->  Same. Apparently the one we did the day Deoxys was announced didn’t count. I’m not salty, you’re salty. 
Cindy R  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ did we get a pass?
Amanda  ----->  @Ian Fraser I’ll give you my invite.
David Busby  ----->  I have a goal post pass. Not sure if that means anything special.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No. Both went out but some people didn’t get either. 
Amanda  ----->  You can invite a Felton person to gp and a Felton can invite you to Felton and do 2 in one day. @David Busby 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Let me make sure I’m not getting one from someone else but thank you @Amanda I’ll let you know. :)
David Busby  ----->  Ooo gotcha. Well back to work for me 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have 2 passes bc Jr got one. Jr is giving holis to Michelle
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My other one can go to someone in this grewp
Amanda  ----->  I wanna make sure everyone that deserves one gets to do one first.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Someone that didn't get one
Amanda  ----->  Since it’s the first one.
Amanda  ----->  That means we can probably make it happen for @Sam Kawell too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Michelle didn't get one despite my best efforts lol. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also don't want to do both. On is good for now
Matt Inger  ----->  I got a Felton pass
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can give @Sam Kawell my main Felton pass. I might need help getting it done bc I could b doing up to 6 accounts already
Ian Fraser  ----->  I can help with some of those accounts. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I can probably help too. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think I can do 3 waves easy. Im more worried about catching it for others
Ian Fraser  ----->  What’s min we’ll need to drop it? 3-4? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll Make a chart if I can find numbers in it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I'm guessing trio with good accounts
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If it's in atk form then you can prob destroy it with very little effort but it's gonna hit like a truck
Sam Kawell  ----->  Sorry @Amanda @Keaton Rhea I was joking. I won't be in Auburn soon and I'd like to get my first Deoxys myself. I'll just need to actually work for it. Thanks though!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean my pass has to go to someone who didn't get it. Might as well be one of the OG
Darren May  ----->  I got Felton too. I guess I’ll give my invite to Snookems but I’m not sure if I’m going to make the raid. Really terrible times for an ex raid
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m sure we can add you to pool of accounts that’ll be done for other people. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It really is a bad time in general unless it's the weekend
Ian Fraser  ----->  Middle of a Monday...what were they thinking??
David Busby  ----->  If it’s middle of Monday I’ll actually be off. Also is there anything worth it in big group? I have like 350 unread messages for today and yesterday 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Big ol fat nothing burger that I could find b
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Nope @David Busby no drama or anything. Kind of sad I need the drama so I can judge people lol. Cindy's still out of town so I'm bored. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I just started powering up on huckleberrys since he hit 38. So is that it now? At 38 your Pokemon are level 40? Cause if that's the case he already has 15 level 40's.
David Busby  ----->  Yup 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  By the time he hits 40 all his relevant pokes will be maxed out.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Fun fact: you can break the "sorting by friendship level" button if you trade with someone. I was searching for Hannah for a while...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This morning at my house
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  �
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Third one.... 
Darren May  ----->  Not quite as cool as a shiny Karp but hatched this guy this morning 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Joseph Spalding @Matt Inger let me know when is good for me to open your gifts for best frands today
Matt Inger  ----->  Right now is good @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Joseph Spalding you good? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Are you on an egg now @Matt Inger ?
Matt Inger  ----->  Yes, first one I’ve used in a while 
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Would you be able to watch davis for a little while? I have a meeting now and it’s under attack
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok ill pop an egg now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And go ahead and open gift @Matt Inger 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Opened
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ill try to watch Davis as well
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looks like they stopped at davis for now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Whew that was close at Davis for your bliss Darren 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So does anyone else in here need an ex invite? 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I do. 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I thought you said you had one. Well time to send my new best frand an invite 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sent
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Proving once again, that Mystic rules and the others drool. Thank you so much, bestie. @Keaton Rhea 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We do @Keaton Rhea for felton. But till niantic takes my personal schedule into consideration lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean who wants to work?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just take a long lunch break! 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I might....we call it flex time and I have plenty lol.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Do you have felton?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I got Felton
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well I’ve peaked. 😱

Hear me out though, I’m not going to max it yet and continue dumping all my candies into my four SB Mu2...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If it's not max it gets the axe. This guy passes the test. He can stay
Blaine, E  ----->  So we remove you until you max it out right? Those ARE the rules @Ian Fraser 😝
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Rulz is rulz!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So, @Darren May Are we becoming best friends today or waiting?
David Busby  ----->  I’ve been waiting on him to open for forever lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He was trying to line up several to do at once. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol he told me to wait. Then he realized he raids with me too much at Davis and Wilmore 
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby I was waiting on you to tell me when to open it. I’ll do them both tonight if that is ok
David Busby  ----->  I’m eating bday dinner with my parents rn then driving back to auburn. What time you usually open?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Just let me know. I should be able to pop an egg whenever. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost you don't really need to walk that Beldum since we'll be getting a community day in October
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, GroupMe just really wants me to tag @David Busby 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I only have 130 beldum candies. I’m trying to get as many as possible before community day so I’m well prepared. 
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby Usually right before I go to bed around 10-10:30. I would double check with you first though. #wildFridaynights
David Busby  ----->  But what if she can’t play during community day? Then you gotta have as many as possible to get as many meteor mash metagross as possible 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Did nobody notice what kind of dinner David is having?  It’s his birthday today, so he deserves extra harassment 😜
David Busby  ----->  Aww don’t make me mute this group too lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm not that confident in the trainers to win, but looking like deoxys will be a cake walk
David Busby  ----->  1919 per charge move sounds op
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oops lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea that's what I'm getting for trainers 2 win
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok good! It's base form so not too hard
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Defense form will b annoying
Joseph Spalding  ----->  My Scizor shall prove to have much valor in combat with Deoxys. 
Cindy R  ----->  Happy Birthday @David Busby !!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I completely missed the pic Sam posted earlier. Happy Birthday to my Blue Brother @David Busby 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby don't know if you've been on Reddit today, but I think you'll like this infographic. I know it made my day
Sam Kawell  ----->  A new mighty moth challenge perchance? These are the butterfly pokes against Deoxys normal
David Busby  ----->  @Taylor Pruitt Might come out of hiding for that 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  If only my perfect dustox would’ve been a beautifly...
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Have this though
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Sam Kawell How many beautifly would you need?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, dustox isn't that good. I don't know how many, but probably a crap ton
Sam Kawell  ----->  Even normal type Deoxys has an insane attack stat
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby @Elizabeth Kidd Yost good to open your gifts now?
David Busby  ----->  Yup. Spots trinity lol
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost ready for me to open your gift?
David Busby  ----->  I popped a lucky egg just in case it did happen. I’m not even upset it just got wasted 😂
Darren May  ----->  The struggle is real
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Go ahead 
David Busby  ----->  Wait no wait like 2 minutes lol
Darren May  ----->  Your eggs already finished @David Busby? I can open yours 
David Busby  ----->  Let me pop a new one real quick so I know it takes affect
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sorry for the delay. We were watching a movie. 
David Busby  ----->  I have 45 seconds left on this one 
Darren May  ----->  Ok I’ll open at 9:20
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sorry @David Busby 
David Busby  ----->  Idc about the eggs. They need to get out my inventory
David Busby  ----->  @Blaine, E Berry stadium for like 2 minutes til I can get back
Blaine, E  ----->  Got it!
David Busby  ----->  Level 19 instinct somehow took that blissey out 
Blaine, E  ----->  Yeah I went to berry you and you were already out
David Busby  ----->  They only got me cause of shitty internet
David Busby  ----->  Well my gps thinks I’m in jordan hate
Blaine, E  ----->  � well they are very persistent and I am almost out of berries thanks to me dumping them all into Boykin haha
David Busby  ----->  No worries I got this assuming I don’t lag out 
Blaine, E  ----->  tag me if you need to for a couple of minutes!
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’ll drop it again on my way back home if anyone is out in about an hour. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Assuming they manage to drop it
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Everybody in here has a pass for Monday right?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Yes and I feel a cough coming on between 10:45 and 1:00. Lol. So I'll have all 3 phones.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So the invite part is...what limited 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It says ultra friends but only pulls in 5 friends to chose from 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You can only invite one person and they have to be ultra. Maybe your other ultra friends have the pass already?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well now it shows 19
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What did y'all Do? Ask around or just click till it went through 
Ian Fraser  ----->  There were two cars at Stadium but one drove off right after we rolled up. 
David Busby  ----->  They were two guys sitting on a bench. I honked and waved. Told me if they gave me ten minutes to get home and on a stable connection I’ll berry for several hours 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I haven’t invited anyone yet @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Can mew learn shadow ball?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Not anymore. It’s legacy now. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I changed mewtwos didn't think about mew
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh I don’t know about new. Read that wrong 
David Busby  ----->  Mew never could. Mewtwo could but legacy now 
David Busby  ----->  @Darren May Doesn’t your mew know shadow claw/dark pulse? And have you been using it against mewtwo 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Should it be dark pulse or ice beam?
David Busby  ----->  Mew or mewtwo?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Mew
David Busby  ----->  There is no right answer to what moveset mew should have 
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby Yeah its not on the Keaton approved list but it’s more interesting than 6 ttars 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I was looking for the next rare candy investment but only if I can use it
David Busby  ----->  So I kinda wanna do a unique 12 poke ex raid duo. I already have level 40 gengar, pinsir, mewtwo, ttar. Working on a scizor. And I could do a mew or a hundo sharpedo
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Duo what
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  With those
David Busby  ----->  Deoxys
David Busby  ----->  Needs same counters as mewtwo 
David Busby  ----->  Oh and I could dump rares into an absol but I don’t wanna do that
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Can absol learn shadow claw
David Busby  ----->  No snarl dark pulse is his preferred moveset I believe
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I have 2 98s with that
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That pitiful hp I just never powered them up
Sam Kawell  ----->  I vote for Beautifly
Sam Kawell  ----->  And shadow claw dark pulse mew does around 70% the damage of shadow ball Mewtwo. Not super good
Sam Kawell  ----->  Actually that mew does almost identical damage as beautifly
Ian Fraser  ----->  This is a random question but has anyone else experienced bugs with Stardust disappearing? Catie’s been sitting around 1mill for months and I just randomly checked today and she at 300k, without any high CP Pokémon to show for it...
David Busby  ----->  I’ll let Darren field this question 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I stole it
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’d believe it if literally anyone but me had her log in info lol. I’m just baffled honestly. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Does she log in with her Google account? Bc someone could log in with that account password if so.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Cannon brew pub! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Man, that grilled cheese burger is the literal best thing ever.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I approve
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Grilled cheese sandwich as the buns. Topped with Mac and cheese and bacon 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Joseph Spalding I think we can hit best friends today. Let me know if you want to coordinate. I haven’t been able to spin many stops today so I can’t send you a gift. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Sure thing. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ive got an egg on now if you want to open my gift @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Oooooweee. Dat empty xp. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Guess what I just hatched out of a 10k? A Porygon......
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I hatched a trapinch
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mmm meat
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Mmmmmm
David Busby  ----->  What do I have to do for some
David Busby  ----->  Name your price
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Unspeakable things
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol
David Busby  ----->  Speak them and they shall be done 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha didn't expect that response 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  When do you all think the boxes are going to go away?
David Busby  ----->  Drunk David used birthday money to buy two more lol 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I almost have enough coins to buy another one without buying more coins, but i was thinking they might go away today so I might have to go ahead and do it. 
David Busby  ----->  I’m scared they’ll leave at 3 today or tomorrow
David Busby  ----->  But I’m gonna be pissed if we get even better boxes like tomorrow 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I did it. I already got my coins for today and was going to need two days worth to buy a box. But yes I’ll be mad if we get better boxes too. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got hungry waiting on ribs so I fried some skrimpz
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Did research change today at 3 or does it change tomorrow?  I don’t know why I’m so confused. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  It should change tomorrow. The Kanto event ended at 3
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So today’s research probably changed bc it usually changes when an event ends. Crap. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Did it change today? I just know suicune will only be available starting tomorrow.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Usually when an event begins/ends the daily research quests from stops change at 3. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, but I don't thin there was any special research for the Kanto event
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Hmm... I don’t know. I was thinking the catch 5 fire types was but I guess we had that before just not the spawns. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ready to fry. We are going on a diet starting tomorrow haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Obese manta
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Looks like we both do the same thing on Sundays 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And they know it too. Waiting on some links. That's cheaper than most doggy snacks lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ looks amazing! 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm mean it's not shrip and ribs but it'll do.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Fries going great. I guess Greta minds think alike for BBQ sun
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's still good food cooked at home 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Did you hear that. I think I just heard @David Busby s  stomach growl lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol I did. It was definitely him
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Just in case you were wondering, research quests did not change at three today. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  And all I have are these stupid dinosaur chicken nuggets.. 😂
David Busby  ----->  I freaking cook for a living and ain’t got shit on Daniel or keaton 
Darren May  ----->  But you still satisfy Leslie and that’s what really matters @David Busby 
David Busby  ----->  Oh god did she say something in mystic or big group? 
David Busby  ----->  I haven’t read up at all 
David Busby  ----->  F for no likes 
Darren May  ----->  Too risky. If you like it, it may get her attention and then she will invite you to trade at Zoe’s 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  You better go check again. Some a-hole just had to like it. @David Busby 
David Busby  ----->  I feel like I know who that a hole is
David Busby  ----->  Suspicion confirmed 😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t know how to get out of this. I like Leslie, but the last time I had lunch with her it was soooooo awkward. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  You sets em up and I knocks em down! 😂
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Oh wow! I thought I was maybe being too mean saying she would then want to meet up at Zoe’s, but nevermind.
David Busby  ----->  I just can’t like that pic Elizabeth 
David Busby  ----->  I feel for you
David Busby  ----->  Only thing left is to fake your death
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  🤣
Ian Fraser  ----->  Isn’t that what you did with Merkitty? 
David Busby  ----->  Gort fixed that problem for me eventually lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Assuming everyone will be there. I am coming. Leaving here at 1045. Should be there by start time.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And hopeful y'all can help me be part of 2 waves. I'll have 3 phones but mystastic account got a pass to.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m not going to make it sadly. I didn’t realize until it was too late to reschedule that Kaitlin has a doctor appointment. No one seems to be sure they can do it for us so I guess we will just catch the next one. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Spots at Davis @Darren May 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost did you get Felton? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I did and so did Kaitlin
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve contemplated going in at hatch and catching on the way to her appointment but then we would be late and I don’t think that sets a very good example. 
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost I can do one for you. Both if we do 3 waves
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That would be great!  Thanks @Darren May 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think I'll be able to do the other. Let me double check to see if I still need to do Phil and slim
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I know you’re already doing a bunch @Keaton Rhea !  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well I think Taylor is going to have Matt D do both GP and Felton for him and Phil now
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I sent Darren my login information 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok Taylor just confirmed that I don't have to do Phil so I can definitely do one of yours Elizabeth. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thanks guys! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Are you going in at hatch with main and then just running through the account you have to do in later raids?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm saving my main and Jr until pharm, myztatic , and any other stragglers show up for a late wave
Ian Fraser  ----->  Alright. Atm I’ll be in that late wave. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, we can prob make like 20 waves. If needed. They are all base form so the duo for lvl 40s is pretty easy. Trio is cake walk
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Make sure Charner gets in a wave y’all. He said he wouldn’t be there until 11:15. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think that me and Jr could even duo it if it had psychic
Darren May  ----->  Need those best friend balls though
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes but I'm hoping it's still a 6% catch rate for ex raids
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So is it looking more like a t4? So sad.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's about as hard as absol lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost who is it's just pet? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No idea. Kicked him out of Felton the other day 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm friends with them. I thought it was jins alt but I really have no idea. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was trying to figure out who it was
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m at the Pharmacy building about to pick up Michelle, Jennifer, and Blaine I think. Be running to Felton as soon as they’re in the car. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea And @Darren May did you do me already?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. I'm an sorry it was very bad IV :/
Darren May  ----->  Yeah got em both
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thank you!  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I like the name @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Feel free to change it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wild lax whittle dorm next to first pres
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Evo 10 water. New drat quest
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Didn't take long to confirm. Duo deoxis 35 sec. Left
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I saw a post today saying that he is technically soloable if you have a best friend chilling in the lobby
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I kind of want something to come out that has to have 20 people to barely do it.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Maybe that would force everybody to grind for stardust and level up pokes. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like the race against the clock for short man. I also like to optimize to carry low lvls. I can't educate them bc they usually don't listen
Blaine, E  ----->  For the love, you should remove him @David Busby . Can't focus on studying 😂
David Busby  ----->  I about tagged you and told you to get back to studying 😂
Blaine, E  ----->  This is becoming a problem! 😅 although I am easily distracted right now anyways...
David Busby  ----->  Sam going for the kill 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  I couldn't resist
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Ian Fraser haley is blue if you are still looking for coins. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I didn't take it
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh I wasn’t looking for coins just to send a message. Decided I didn’t care enough though. Thanks! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R tomorrow is the day! I have been eating a lot of empty exp lately and I'm just not full
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea , my week off delayed mine. Lol.  Just let me know what time tomorrow. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I hit ultra with huckleberry and Jenny if she ever opens my gift from like a week ago
Ian Fraser  ----->  And here Taylor hasn’t opened any of my gifts for weeks. Feels bad man 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I hit ultra with him yesterday 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or maybe day b4? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh Jenny and that Taylor. Yeah I got ultra with him a long time ago then he stopped opening them
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He opens mine occasionally. We’re eight days from ultra. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It really doesn't benefit either of them bc he is not raiding with us. They are both already 40 too so empty exp waste
Keaton Rhea  ----->  How is everyone else's frands list looking? I'm at 9 best (soon to b 10) and 47 ultra. 
David Busby  ----->  I might have you beat on ultra by a couple 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m not
David Busby  ----->  8 best and I have Pete tomorrow 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah my ultra's have all gone dry. I'm looking for new frands that open my gifts. I'm about to delete sabi
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  6 best, 55 ultra
David Busby  ----->  55 ultra 56 if @Michelle U wants to open
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sabi has actually been opening mine and sending me gifts. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Useless Sabi. He has had that gift for ever
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My guess is he is lining up multiple ultra
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We’ll be ultra in three days
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I've been at 2 days for well over a week
David Busby  ----->  No I think he just sucks at gifts 
David Busby  ----->  Too busy liking posts to gift
Blaine, E  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost  I think we are best tomorrow!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I know it’s soon!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess I can't complain. The ppl in this grewp open my gifts
David Busby  ----->  Not anymore
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Me and @Sam Kawell too!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought you still wanted gifts?
David Busby  ----->  Just messing with keaton
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hey I did you a favor recently, David.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But yes I don't open best frands gifts right now 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If I ever have a night when I don’t have twenty to open I will open the gifts I have from best friends just to get rid of them 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Same. But I usually wait to see if I get another b4 I go to bed, then forget to even open the others
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I am going to San Diego next week so you guys will have to let me know if you want long distance gifts. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm good. Prioritize others, but thank you! 
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost You have to go to donut bar while you’re there. It is incredible 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thanks for the tip. Keven is a big donut fan. 
Darren May  ----->  I would go to San Diego just to go back there. Make sure you get there early bc they sell them until they run out 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Matt Inger @Keaton Rhea do y'all want to lucky egg for huckleberry opens your uktravfriend eggs
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have stopped it for ultra unless it's combined with a best. But the real question is how close is Cindy? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Any other must dos @Darren May ?  I was put in charge of researching things to do but I haven’t gotten very far. 
Cindy R  ----->  Lol, you are way ahead....
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost I’m about to run an errand so I’ll get back to you on that. Any things you guys are interested in? Like historical places, sightseeing, food?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Maybe a mix of all those things. 
David Busby  ----->  Ok I literally can’t take an effing gym. Getting error 2, 29, and 30 every single battle
Matt Inger  ----->  Sucks.  I’ve been getting them a lot as well
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've been getting them with trades with me and Jrn it's not your fault 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I was getting them all day today. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Happens to me all the time. Why do you think I don’t take gyms? 😂😜😉
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea 🤷‍♀️
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Some of those errors use to be from people spoofing to a gym. Anyone after would have problems.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Tell Sabi to play I the road
Keaton Rhea  ----->  In the 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  "I the road" sounds like a game you just can't win.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay I have to ask this for my own morbid curiosity but does anyone know if Kento’s perfect Mewtwo has SB? 
David Busby  ----->  This will be answered when yours is level 40 😜
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sigh...I just wanted to know if I have a right to be salty that mine had be after SB was legacy. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  The sad part is I have the dust...just not enough Rare Candy while I’m trying to bring SB up..
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You just need to catch more mewtwos and get more candy 😜
Darren May  ----->  Doesn’t Pete’s hundo have focus blast?
David Busby  ----->  That’s cause Pete had a level 40 perfect machamp with close combat
David Busby  ----->  Pete doesn’t count 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sure just a measly 634 Mewtwo candy later....
David Busby  ----->  Wait how many shadow ball mewtwos you working on?
David Busby  ----->  I had one maxed and changed the focus blast one at 30 with shit ivs and just left it at that
Ian Fraser  ----->  3. That’s those 3 to 40 plus the hundo
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s only like 126 raids (assuming you catch them all)
David Busby  ----->  I’d prioritize the hundo for now. But I’m really only saying that cause it’s a hundo. If you got to let your ttars do the work 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So..mewtwo shadow ball.....is this a team worth doing for something in the future?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Also is there word on what's after mewtwo. I have rare candies that need to go toward something.
David Busby  ----->  Yes but only if your trying to really short man something I think. Other than that ttars pretty much function the same just with slightly worse dps 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean I’m probably alright on my team...it’s just so hard to push myself to dump the rare candy into not the best moveset. I’ll do it though. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also no one has any clue what’s after Mewtwo atm
David Busby  ----->  I gotta work a crap ton so I’m betting on shiny ray or Groudon
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  🙁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Ian Fraser the break point for PC on mu2 VS mu2 is at like only lvl 23.5. yes you get more for SB at higher lvls, but that is prob good enough for a solid short man raid
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May do you care when I open your gift today?
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell Actually yes. I hit best with matt d too so I’d like to be able to do them at the same time. (Which is super fun to coordinate) I’m leaning towards having you both open anytime from 5-9 and I’ll just open the app afterwards and immediately lucky egg. Would that work for you?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May davis?
Darren May  ----->  Nah, I’m leaving for lunch at 11:40
Darren May  ----->  😬
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I can in ~15 depending on how fast this line at chikfila moves
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr is keeping davis blue lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip obesity who got shaved b4 I noticed
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May I think there is a while network of people wanting to coordinate gift opening today so I made a separate groio
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E something to share? 
Blaine, E  ----->  😁
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Shut the front door!!!!!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  We can’t be frands anymore. 
Michelle U  ----->  😮😮😮😮😱
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I give a hundo and all I get is this trash... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They grow up so fast! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Good thing I saved some stardust. Really getting low
Blaine, E  ----->  🙄
David Busby  ----->  That moveset tho 
David Busby  ----->  Also what happened with Leslie? She apologized in big groupfor the library?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Jin and Matt are my heroes. Apparently Pete asked Jon to take the library and Matt was there defending it. Jin talked to Matt, Matt talked to Leslie and boom!  The war is over. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  At least that’s what Jin said. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I fixed that @David Busby 
Blaine, E  ----->  😍 that name though 
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Wilmore?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm about to head home but chase says storm are going to be doing it soon 
Darren May  ----->  Well let me duck into storm chat and find the time 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May  Matt Dillon says he’s opening your gift at 5. 
Amanda  ----->  @Darren May ^^^^
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  But you need to send him one @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  I dmed him hours ago and he never responded. Friendship is too much work🤦‍♂️
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea , when you want to open gifts?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm ready whenever
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm going to egg it then close the app lol
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea @David Busby @Elizabeth Kidd Yost could one of you send me a gift now? I’d like to have a notification buffer before matt and Sam open my gifts
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sent
Darren May  ----->  Now that’s a true best friend 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Hey! I sent one too!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I posted two new drat off campus. Purple heart and termite cannon
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Well obviously you are a true best friend too
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Phew!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R just @me when u want me to open gift 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or if you have one you can open it too
Cindy R  ----->  I can do it now if you are ready @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes gimme sec to open app lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Egg is on. Fire away! 
Cindy R  ----->  Yay..
Cindy R  ----->  You were my #3...give me a week and I will clear 10. 😁
Cindy R  ----->  Ok, weird.  It's not showing my egg timer. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  In 10 days I'll get 7 or so more. Then I'll slow down a bit 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I just know I’m going to open pogo and have a best friend alert that I didn’t get to egg. ☹️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Then are they really ur best frand? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He doesn’t even live here anymore so no. No he’s not 😩
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip. No way to contact him? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve tagged him in mystic and dm’d him. And Sam added him to his besties group. I’ve dm’d him before and he took a day or two to respond but he usually opens my gifts everyday. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well I'm sorry. I hope he does it when ur egging some one else! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  At least I got a good 500,000 empty xp today. 
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost If you immediately go into the friends screen when opening the app, you can check if he has opened and if your quick/lucky enough, then pop a lucky egg 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m confused. What is Tim referring to? What did Charner say that was bad?  
Ian Fraser  ----->  I thought Tim was referring to Hunter and what about I’m truly not sure 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Not sure what he was talking about but several times over the past few weeks has been a d@#$ in the chat.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Apparently Taylor is still in a bad mood. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I thought he got a new phone tho….
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He was asleep when UPS came. It’s coming today. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Did you see what he posted in mystic? He’s being an ass 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh, didn't see that. And yeah, I wish he wouldn't take out his anger on everyone else.
Darren May  ----->  Based upon my investigation it was mtpokecatcher who ruined the theme. She probably has no idea what they are. If I wasn’t going to work I’d post an explanation to her but that seems more like an @Amanda or @Elizabeth Kidd Yost task to me
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  iChat was the theme?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  *What
Darren May  ----->  Pink
Darren May  ----->  She dropped a ttar 4th then Jose dropped something pink then that other person dropped a vape. I mean really the only themes people do is pink, eevee or shiny. Plus with pink blissey and chansey could reasonably be dropped first with no intention of a theme
Ian Fraser  ----->  Intentionally antagonizing people is just as bad as Taylor snapping at people. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I wish I’d waited to send her a dm. She might not have even seen his post if I hadn’t brought it to her attention. Live and learn. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That kind of shit should have been posted in NC17 if he wanted to be a bitch about it
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That was uncalled for in the pleb chat and he gets whatever flak he deserves imo. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  But now she won’t stop and it’s annoying. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Does she mainly play Opelika? Can't remember 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No but she’s super casual and plays with her daughter. I asked if she wanted to be added back to big group for raids (to change the subject) and she said no. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  He sounds just like Pseduo. And he despises Pseduo. 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Oh can I be the one to say it...😁😁😁
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought the same thing!  I think he changed his tone about pseudo though. I don’t know. He says whatever he thinks the person he’s talking to wants to hear. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I don't know....hes said some things I think I could have done with out lol.
Ian Fraser  ----->  They ruined my good gym defenders theme 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I even saw snookems in gym today so I left it lol
Darren May  ----->  I had just dropped him when I saw you took 1865. I get more enjoyment from dropping his trash in yellow gyms than taking them down 
David Busby  ----->  Hit send or nah
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nah. Dm him, we had dropped it until Leslie brought it back
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also *you’re
Darren May  ----->  Also I’m not ready to say we can’t publicly shame people for screwing up the themes. Taylor just did it really poorly
Amanda  ----->  Shiny eeveelution or bust. I did it
Amanda  ----->  Taylor was out right mean instead of just passive aggressive 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @David Busby that sounds like me. Don t me be lol
Amanda  ----->  Also, I elect Darren the new Mystic explainer.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sounds just like David actually 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  I was about to say..
Amanda  ----->  David = Mr. Iron Fist
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Me right now with the Mystic chat
Amanda  ----->  What they reminded me of though 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean they are old enough that they should act like mature adults. I'm just a dumb college student and I know how to do that. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Hell, I’m an immature adult college student and know there’s a place and a time for those kind of shenanigans. 
Amanda  ----->  We don’t mature. We become more accountable and responsible.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And that sucks
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  No fun being responsible lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  As I'm at work chatting lol.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Whoaaaa, we’re halfway there 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Ian Fraser 
Ian Fraser  ----->  That’s me! Gotta make sure that gym stay blue. Least till I have my coins. :P 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @ian spots Haley
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Me and some lvl 23 had to make some instank player his berry limit 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Sam Kawell I cant handle how freakin cute he is. And the onsey is perfect! 😃
Ian Fraser  ----->  I probably won’t be back on campus before it’s full up again. Ah well, thanks for letting me know. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Wrong chat. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought we were done with this?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess they are not
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  When I drove by earlier it was red with full motivation and Will had not dropped a pidgey but I guess Shelley and Leslie were able to take it so maybe he is not watching it as closely. 
Matt Inger  ----->  Pete wasn’t in there today. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Some clever target employee got one of those red balls outside the store turned into a pokestop
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I am assuming that is in HSV/Madison . Which target was it? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Actually it's in Destin
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We need to tell Bob about that Target. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Bob has had 2 already added at the village. So I'm sure he can make it happen if you ask nice enough 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He has had like six added. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The more stops we get, the more researcher chances we get 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Never seen one of these in the wild before!
Matt Inger  ----->  So is Deoxys worth powering up?  Should I switch it from psychic to electric?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Matt Inger deoxys is worse than mu2 in every way. I'm not going to say don't power it up, but it's not going to be meta relavant 
Matt Inger  ----->  Thanks!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, it is technically the best electric attacker, but it is not much higher than Raikou and it has 1/3 the survivability.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It might have a use *might* in PvP if that ever exists. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Some sort of suicide bomber with hyper beam? Never know with how they will do it tho
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I caught two Pikachu with my gotcha but they don’t have hats 😕
David Busby  ----->  Puts casual hat on... pikachus with hats are back?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  And they’re shiny
Ian Fraser  ----->  Someday the number of different hat Pikachus will reach critical mass and achieve the singularity. All thanks to Niantic. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t know they were shiny. Usually when there are hat pikachus they all have hats. I guess I probably won’t get one then. 
David Busby  ----->  Apparently new pikas are out til Sunday at one. Meaning I won’t get one unless I go out right now
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Are you sure they aren’t all supposed to have hats?  When I transfer it asks if I really want to transfer the event Pokemon.  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ok. I restarted the app and now they have hats. Yay!  @David Busby They are everywhere so you should be able to get at least one. 
David Busby  ----->  I’m sick of them already
David Busby  ----->  Also Leslie has no idea how to drive around the museum
Joseph Spalding  ----->  You seem surprised by that fact @David Busby 🤣
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Cindy R We become besties tomorrow!  I can probably do it in the afternoon or late at night but I need to coordinate with Adam too. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Not too shabby
Keaton Rhea  ----->  To da top! 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Gonna need someone to swing by the mountains 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Would if I could man
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The downfall of a gotcha/go plus
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Does fog also boost mewtwo?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes fog boosts psychic, dark, and ghost 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh wait that might b wrong. Windy was the boost for psychic. So only dark and ghost @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ur ttar and gengar will b boosted
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think its a stupid hard trio in foggy, but still possible 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Random shot from the train
Sam Kawell  ----->  What mountains are you in @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ ?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  City called blue rigde....georgia Tenn border
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  A little cheese for the day....why us it called tyrant corn?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Cindy R I’m going to pop a lucky egg at 3:00. Does that work for you?
Cindy R  ----->  Sure.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m read @Cindy R you can open anytime. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Did you need Cindy to open @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ok let me get her phone just got service again lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  She just did
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Woo boo!  Thanks guys!  
Cindy R  ----->  So sorry I didnt realize you didnt have a gift from me.  We were unloading groceries.  
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Now that I have Wi-Fi it's called tyrant corn because it's a buckanier......get it....a buck...$   an ear.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No problem!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was able to get three besties on one egg 😁
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sorry bad train conductor humor.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm a day early @Keaton Rhea but a much better veiw.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looking good! Save me a plate. I'm prob only 5 hrs away haha
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Lol that drive way is.....welk Cindy wouldn't let go of the handles lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm sure I won't miss it. Perfect directions! 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Joseph Spalding  we become best friends today! Let me know if/when you want to egg it
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Give me about 20 seconds
Blaine, E  ----->  Oh I wasn't expecting that soon lol sounds good �
Joseph Spalding  ----->  You’re good to go
Blaine, E  ----->  sent you a gift - I don't have one from you
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Sorry meant to ask are you gtg. lol
Blaine, E  ----->  lol I am now
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Thanks Bestie!!!! 👯 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mmm steak
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  No cooking for us tonight but I'm gonna Trump your steak and raise with......
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May I'm back
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Aw...is that Hannah’s ferret?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Furret 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  🤣🤣🤣 Taylor is such an ass, but I know everyone has thought it at one point. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Too much of an ass sometimes. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  You guessed it!
Amanda  ----->  I’m going to end up saying something to Taylor.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He’s really not being nice. 
Amanda  ----->  Working on my phrasing now.
David Busby  ----->  I told him I’m kicking him next time he was a dick...
David Busby  ----->  So can I kick yet?
Amanda  ----->  You know my opinion on exclusion.
David Busby  ----->  This isn’t exclusion because your not “good enough.” This is exclusion because he literally can’t play nice 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He can, he is choosing not to. 
David Busby  ----->  That’s even worse imo
Amanda  ----->  I’m too tired for all of it, and will address it in the morning. A big headed monster has been created with Taylor, and it just needs to be knocked bag down a few notches in a kind way.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He is so desperate to impress certain people and he thinks he will do it by being a dick. 
Amanda  ----->  Meanwhile....
David Busby  ----->  Well I guess that’s just the difference in our styles lol
Amanda  ----->  We are Mystic. We are nice. Even to Kento😁
David Busby  ----->  Right I mean I can at least be not mean to him
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m not sure which is worse, being flat out mean to people or being nice enough that they actually think you like them. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Definitely being flat out mean. We’re all nice to people we don’t necessarily want to be every day. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Just read up and I appreciate Ian trying to carry on a normal conversation in the middle of all the drama
Ian Fraser  ----->  I tried to distract people with numbers. It was mildly effective. 😅
David Busby  ----->  Ian used baffle them with bullshit
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I give you an a plus but I'm tired of ignoring it. If he's an add toward people kick him from the chat. Give him a few stikes by letting him back but otherwise him and pseudo can have there own chat.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Add...lol....ass 
David Busby  ----->  My votes with Daniel but I know the rest of you don’t have what it takes 😜
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think we all knew what you meant @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  How about three strikes and he’s out - this was #2
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm with Elizabeth. I don't know him very well, but I think he is fully aware how mean he is being. If he was being unintentionally annoying (kentoo) that'd be different, but he's not.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And we need to point it out to him
Ian Fraser  ----->  He should be made aware of those strikes however. Probably something someone more diplomatic than David should do that tho. 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  But I definitely don’t think we should keep tolerating his meanness. 
David Busby  ----->  My thing is I warned him specifically about being a dick in chats. And he keeps doing it 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  
He'd be crushed if Phil changed  his password. Then he would need the common players to raid with lol.

Amanda  ----->  @David Busby You’re one of my favorite people. Being forceful with adults doesn’t work. Crap. It doesn’t work with kids either.
Cindy R  ----->  Wow..just catching up..he is being a jerk. 
Amanda  ----->  I have a stubborn af red headed 14 yr. old to prove it.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  True be it feels good to p@## them off lol
David Busby  ----->  Oh we want to get technical he did already get booted from big chat once
David Busby  ----->  And I know but I’m stubborn af too
Amanda  ----->  Yes. He creeped me out.
Amanda  ----->  And he claims he was never there.
Amanda  ----->  I don’t trust him.
David Busby  ----->  Well someone needs to say something to him. I know if he ticks me off one more time by saying something about me I will personally destroy him
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, I think it it needs to be one of the people he is trying to impress which does not include me so I vote for Amanda. 
David Busby  ----->  Her and Darren seem to be the most eloquent in here 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Who's he trying to impress? ....
Ian Fraser  ----->  Basically any of the “elite” 
David Busby  ----->  Whoever is closest to him at the moment fr 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Dang...i guess I'm just not elite...lol
David Busby  ----->  Nah your just not around him enough
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Damn the drama is thick up in here. What’s the TLDR version?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Taylor gets off on being an ass
Amanda  ----->  ^^^^^yup. That is all
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Oh. Damn. Thought I missed something of note.🤣
Ian Fraser  ----->  Really no. Kento said usual Kento stuff about multi accounts. Taylor decided to be more of an ass than usual. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Dat hundo doe!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  To da top! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  So much stardust 😂
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Don’t you judge me @Ian Fraser My stardust addiction is a disease!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I am judging you
Ian Fraser  ----->  Beginning to think we need an intervention...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  No
Cindy R  ----->  You make me feel better about my constant lack of dust!  LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And the funny thing was Joe was mad that I posted a bunch of 1k dust quests on the site! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This also happened this morning
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I was mad, because you’re enabling my disease by doing that.  @Keaton Rhea 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  U need it obviously! Just bc I provide the crack doesn't mean you gotta take it 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  also... I may have done a few of them. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm doing as many as I can. It's basically 2k dust bc u get 100 for each catch. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And I'm so dust deprived... 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Chats mighty quiet tonight. Did anyone ever talk or chat with Taylor? Just curious.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I did talk to him at a raid this morning and told him he needed to stop being so mean in chat. I did not tell him he had one more strike though. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  What’d he say? 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  He had to have been drunk AF last night cuz he reeked of booze this morning. Not that it excuses his behavior any...
David Busby  ----->  Shit I drink every night and the worst thing that’s came out of it Pokémon related is bad jokes and money spent on boxes 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Your box history must be ruff lol.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’d be broke as a joke from boxes if I still drank. 😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He said people pissed him off and I told him that was no reason to be mean in chat. 
David Busby  ----->  He literally started it 
David Busby  ----->  Am I allowed to tell Taylor he has no freaking clue about what he should put dust into
David Busby  ----->  I think his only level 40s are a ho and a  milotic
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And a perfect mewtwo 
David Busby  ----->  Oh I forgot about that
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He knows ttars are good. And last I heard he was working on his machamps. So he’s not totally clueless. 
David Busby  ----->  He’s got two 40 champs and 3 40 sd ttars which I’m super surprised at. So not bad but after that it’s just trash. And really at that point you don’t wanna max you wanna focus on the solid team 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  And I’m the one catching shit for dumping dust into hundos... I demand a recount!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I usually power up based on whatever is a good counter for the current raid boss, but lately those counters have been the same. I could put more dust into my ttars but none of them are all that great so I haven’t. 
Cindy R  ----->  @Darren May today is the day for both your acct and snookems.  Let me know when you want to do it. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks @Elizabeth Kidd Yost !if only I had candies lol
David Busby  ----->  Wait why don’t you have larvitar candy?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  SD ttar.... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  This is unfortunate 😐. I haven’t gone through everything yet. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  8 ttar at 40, 6 more well into 30.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Did you check ObeseManta? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  89
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not the worst! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Thoughts?
Sam Kawell  ----->  https://pokemongolive.com/post/sinnoh-tease/
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Stat rework? Yes. Gen 4? Yes.  Weather system no longer influences spawns? Yes. More varied spawns? Yes. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I really don't know what of those is more exciting
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I concur on all points 
Sam Kawell  ----->  But I feel bad for these guys
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also looks like grintia might be next raid boss
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And all the 420, 666 ones
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Varied spawns for me. Catching anything besides shitty grass pokes out here in the country would be a godsend. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's prob gonna be a mega nerf to bliss/chan
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They want to close the HP gap
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm a big fan of that. And they also implied that defensive Pokemon will be more useful. So maybe the Regis won't be such trash
Darren May  ----->  I like the weather spawns though because of variety and boosts though. I guess if we are getting the variety anyways I’m fine with that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My main issue is it's almost always sunny in AL. I don't want grass all the time. I'm fine with just making it less of an influence and actually increasing the spawn pool of normal spawns
Darren May  ----->  Well if they added more variety so that we got ground and fire as well that would be nice. Weather has been good for ralts today. I only had a couple from the event before today
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes they said they are trying to increase the spawn pool. Especially in parks
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The current implementation of the weather system is very annoying. All it does is rotate what common trash u catch and the only good weather is PC for grinding mass evo fodder. In normal cloudy I never see ralts period. 
Darren May  ----->  As long as samford lawn is considered one of those parks
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  At three birds stop now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think all the places that are green in overworld map should b considered as a 'park' 
Darren May  ----->  @Cindy R I can open gifts now or tonight at 9-10. I don’t really care about Snookems unless you do since it’s ultra and he has no lucky eggs. He does have the instinct hat though 🤦‍♂️
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nvm I got reinforcements 🤣 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ur good lol. I mean I guess I can go over but I'm lazy
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nah I think they stopped 
Cindy R  ----->  @Darren May sorry, we went through an area of spotty cell service.  If you can still open yours now that works for me.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Better Ian? 
Darren May  ----->  @Cindy R Sorry I’m back at work now. I can do tonight if that works or wait until whenever. I can also send you a gift to open if you want to open anytime from like 5-9 and I’ll just lucky egg when I open the app
Cindy R  ----->  Ok sounds good.  If you shoot me one I will open around 5.
Darren May  ----->  Cool just let me know when you open it 
Cindy R  ----->  @Darren May , gonna open the gift
Sam Kawell  ----->  Check out this bad boy
Joseph Spalding  ----->  2 da ⬆️
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea @Joseph Spalding wilmore mewtwo? Hatches at 10:07. Assuming it isn’t raining
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Me + Blaine are down. Pls no rain until later! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Sure. Count me in. @Darren May 
Ian Fraser  ----->  My account can do it if someone wants to grab my phone 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can grab it on way over @Ian Fraser 
Darren May  ----->  Hatch time ok then?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hatch works for me
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Hatch sounds good
Darren May  ----->  It raining. We still doing it?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May we are here
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's not raining too hard. We inside 
Darren May  ----->  Ok I’m omw. Boss had me for questioning 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We have Ian's phone too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No worries we just got here
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea @Joseph Spalding wilmore again?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes but driving to Dixie now
David Busby  ----->  I’ll do it after graves 
Darren May  ----->  Ok just @me when you’re leaving graves
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We en route @Darren May 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Coming in hot
Amanda  ----->  We’re gonna park in that cut thing
Darren May  ----->  I’m here. Can start the lobby if needed.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Besties let me know if you want long distance gifts from San Diego. 
Darren May  ----->  Just logged into my father in laws account to open a gift I sent days ago that would make us ultra friends to maximize a lucky egg. #notcasual
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I found a larvitar quest in San Diego!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Don't know if it's been posted, but check your Pokedex tabs
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Finally. It wasn’t there earlier when I checked mine after you called it out. @Sam Kawell 
Darren May  ----->  I guess I can live with this possibly being my only boosted mutu 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It's official.....you/casuals suck lol.
Ian Fraser  ----->  I swear if they drop Gen4 the weekend I’m out of town... 🙃
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost I would take a gift from San Diego. I have to keep my mystic peeps above matt d.
Darren May  ----->  Windy weather and nothing on campus. Maybe davis will be a boosted kirlia 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May it is boosted
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Kirlia
Darren May  ----->  Oh I’m in the lobby right now
Darren May  ----->  Sigh 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm gonna wait and save my pass. I would put a unboosted lvl 15 mu2 raid capture over a boosted krila
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip. Sorry! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Catie has a 96 boosted Kirilia I caught for her and the best I have is like an 89...feelsbadman. 
Darren May  ----->  I’d rather do mewtwo but it is hard to pass up a guaranteed raid that I can do quickly. I have premiums for any nearby mewtwos
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Are we missing something? A  certain weather boosted mon that was captured yesterday? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E 
Blaine, E  ----->  Thanks for catching it for me @Keaton Rhea ! 😁
Joseph Spalding  ----->  spots at first pres
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wrong chat @Joseph Spalding lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ahh. Well, it works here too. 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E let's see it
Blaine, E  ----->  😁
Blaine, E  ----->  Good luck lately
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Wooooohoo!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  2da ⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Didn’t know you could catch these in the wild. I’ve caught two today. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They are very biome dependant 
Amanda  ----->  @Darren May Did you see...
Darren May  ----->  Holy!!
Darren May  ----->  Guess I will come out of retirement and go to the museum tonight
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay what’s with the events inside events inside events...? 
Amanda  ----->  Our exact convo right now
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  What are you talking about @Amanda and @Darren May ?
Amanda  ----->  What he said😁
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, I’ve only seen one midi queen and Balboa Park is a f’in yanma nest 😫
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost What about La Jolla nest?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Haven’t been there yet. I think we’re going there on Saturday. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Any particular time you want me to open the give for bff tomorrow? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  *gift
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t get a pass for Felton so if anybody wants to share with me I would appreciate it 😄
Ian Fraser  ----->  I might have one if Catie can’t make it. Have to double check on that 
Amanda  ----->  I’ve got you covered. 
Darren May  ----->  I didn’t get one either but I always feel weird doing it without Snookems so I’m in search of 2. Or I’ll just skip this one.
Darren May  ----->  Unrelated, has anyone caught a shiny nidoran yet? I haven’t seen any posts 🤔
Sam Kawell  ----->  Speaking of which first shiny evolution has appeared!
Sam Kawell  ----->  (aside from Pikachu)
Darren May  ----->  Reaching David levels of salt
David Busby  ----->  I’ve been summoned?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ive got one for you @Darren May I’m sure we can scrounge up one more guest pass for snookems
Darren May  ----->  Slight snag, snookems only has 7 ultra friends and I know at least 2 of them did not get a pass
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wild shiny Nidoqueen is confirmed now too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Ian Fraser i should be able to egg most of the day. Just let me know when you are ready
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May Yum!  Thanks for the recommendation!
Darren May  ----->  😱
Darren May  ----->  Did the owner have his lambo parked out front?
Cindy R  ----->  @David Busby today is the day!  Let me know when you want to open the gift. 
David Busby  ----->  I can do it now if you’d like
Cindy R  ----->  Sure, go for it and I will pop an egg
Cindy R  ----->  @David Busby 
David Busby  ----->  My eggs on I’ll open in a minute!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ready @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes gimme 1 sec 
David Busby  ----->  Cindy put me at 14 best. What’s the number after Ian?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ready @Ian Fraser 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Egg on
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby 14 with 2 more tomorrow 
Blaine, E  ----->  *unlike*
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May I didn’t see one. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I can’t believe I have more best friends than @Keaton Rhea!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Elizabeth OP! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve caught a bunch of ralts out here so be sure to save some to trade with me!  Extra 🍬 😁
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And zero worth keeping lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  A very mad teddy. He hates hair cuts. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So true @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ !
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F U all - said teddy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No u guys. Just us bc we made him get the hair cut
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Princess mad too
Amanda  ----->  They cute tho.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well take that
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea you need coins? I’m probably gonna take myself out of Sam Harris 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't but go ahead
David Busby  ----->  I’ll leave you in then unless my phone won’t cooperate 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can't check up see if I got coins. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Waiting on Lucky egg for best frands lol
David Busby  ----->  Oh well would you rather me leave you in or take you out?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think it's a reasonable goal to have 40 level 40 pokemon on huckleberrys account by the time he hits 40?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Kill me! @David Busby 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't care lol
David Busby  ----->  That makes it easier on df3 lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  GP passes just went out
Darren May  ----->  @Blaine, E I’m not going to be at Felton tomorrow. Is there another time that is convenient for you to become best friends?
Blaine, E  ----->  Not available at all from 2-5 but can manage at any other time probably. What works for you?
Darren May  ----->  I can do at lunch or if you open any time from 5-9pm works for me.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Does anyone in here want a gift from San Diego?  I have nine left but I kind of what to send them to people who really want to try for an egg. 
Cindy R  ----->  Dont waste on us...we have our distance badge. 🙂
Sam Kawell  ----->  So I think I moved to a new level of nerd-dome... I just downloaded the GAME_MASTER file from my phone and am spending the evening looking over it. Fun fact, you can get a master ball if you get to level 100
Ian Fraser  ----->  Looks like Keaton has a new mission. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, there are still no more gen 4 stats or moves in the file yet, so take all online analysis with a grain of salt. No one knows anything for sure.
David Busby  ----->  I mean usually I agree with you but they keep tweeting about gen 4
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm not talking about release date speculation, just attacker/defender tier analysis
David Busby  ----->  Also in this meta how important is a master ball? I’d be saving it fr pretty much. Maybe last ball on a hundo legend I REALLY want? But then I’d be thinking about the legends of the next gen and what would happen if I were in that same situation then
David Busby  ----->  Shiny legends being a guarantee means I don’t have to worry about missing them 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Darren May I will open it after 5 then!
Ian Fraser  ----->  So I read my times for the ex raid not thinking about the time change from EST to CST. I have a phone call from 9:30-10am. Is there anyway I could get a ride from campus to Felton for a late wave? Are you driving there @Keaton Rhea ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I will b driving from campus but I will b doing 4 accounts so I would like to be there by hatch
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I also need to do two rounds. And I’m supposed to meet up with Mimiloma to do Matt’s account so I should probably get there early. I don’t mind waiting for a late wave on my account though. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Alright I’ll see if I can find another ride. If you wanted I could do at least two of those account with you though, I can give me pass to Catie and do hers. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I might b able duo with Phil and my main. Jr didn't even get a pass
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No idea what Phil has
Ian Fraser  ----->  Does Jr want a pass? I could give it to him instead 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Give it to a real account 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Crap. I forgot about the EST/CST kerfluffle. I’ve got an appointment with my advisor at 10:15. 🤦‍♂️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can do yours Joe if you need
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That would be great. Odds are very high that I would not make it to felton in time. 
Darren May  ----->  @Matt Inger We hit best today too. Can you open a gift from 5-9?
Matt Inger  ----->  Sounds good
Darren May  ----->  R.I.P. Bertha. She just lost 500cp
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😱
Ian Fraser  ----->  Think DG damage went up though...
Darren May  ----->  Sort by hp and look at the carnage 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Bliss is stupid easy to take out. Like 20s for me on one at haley
Ian Fraser  ----->  Dang, really? At full motivation? Well I’m both sad and excited to see who the new top tier defenders will be..
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It did about the same amount of dmg and a normal battle. Didn't even kill a champ tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It crashed and we couldn't get back in. We wanted to try a steelix or aggron
Ian Fraser  ----->  Looks like they buffed Machamp too. 😄😄
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes champ and Mr Ray Ray 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dnite and ttar got huge jumps too 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My 3.5k ray was at like 3.85k
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sooo likely the top tier attackers stays the same. Only thing that’ll change is the gym defense game. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes most likely
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Vap, exe, and alakazam all felt the same. Champ still wins
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It looks like they nerfed almost every mons def Stat. And added around 20 to 40 HP
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Except for bliss (lost 60 def and 14 HP) . Most mons got HP added
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Bliss and Chan are the only ones that lost def And HP lol
Darren May  ----->  3 lileeps have spawned on samford lawn in the past 20 minutes. It is not a nesting species is it?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think they can
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I know omnyte and kabuto can
Darren May  ----->  Gen 4 in 5 minutes? Everything normally happens at 3
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I hope so
Keaton Rhea  ----->   Nests prob changed 
Darren May  ----->  Nests have definitely changed. I didn’t think Lileep could nest though. Oh well
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't remember if they could b4 but looks like they can now! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  For a couple weeks I saw a lileep at the tennis courts on Samford every time I was nearby and that was a nest at one point. 
Darren May  ----->  Tennis court is still a nest but no one really cares to investigate and report them these days. At least until gen 4 comes out
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes currently there is not really any nesting mons to go after. Most ppl are full on champ
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, yeah. I haven’t known what was nesting there in like a year. I used to park there for events at Dean Road and I always knew what it was but then the took out the bridge between the school board parking lot and the school so I quit. 
Darren May  ----->  Snookems and I walked there in the middle of winter for our first girafarigs and now I just finished ignoring girafrig research quests
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I caught my first girafarig there and my first Jynx 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Same with first girafarig. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, at least this is confirmed. I’m disappointed that I don’t see shadows on my tracker though 😐
Blaine, E  ----->  About yo open you gift @Darren May !
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Sam Kawell So will your level 1 Pokémon still be level 1 after they do the nerf for real?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Haha, yep. All they're doing is changing how the main series base defensive and HP stats are converted to pogo. The base attack and levels will stay the same.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  In that case, are you interested in any of these?  I know we already talked about the heracross. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  They changed nesting species at least some. So Lileep might actually be nesting now 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Um, I would def be interested in the shiny dratini and the Magmar to a less extent. 
Darren May  ----->  Yeah samford lawn is definitely lileep
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I didnt realize that I was hitting ultra with JR until I opened the gift...I'm sorry!!! Pop an egg when you open his if you want that experience.  Again..so sorry!! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Did Parker have someone log in for him in NZ? I didn’t think he’s spoofed. 
David Busby  ----->  Yes
David Busby  ----->  Openly admits it
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Who parker...hes not the only one
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean that’s alright in my book I guess...I was considering trying to guide my airline employed through logging in for me in EU prior to trading..
Ian Fraser  ----->  *airline employed friend 
David Busby  ----->  Hey any of my peeps in here have a legacy champ?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Nope
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don’t. I wasn’t hardcore enough that early on
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Double nope. I never powered one up until you all made me lol.
David Busby  ----->  Dang I think you Cindy and keaton were my best bets
David Busby  ----->  Although Darren did work on the og chop nest...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  He would’ve been my first guess
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I wish there was battle stats going to the beginning. 2 executors and this guy tore down every gym for the first year. No machamp needed lol.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Caught in the wild 9/9/16
Sam Kawell  ----->  16!!!!!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh, lol. I thought you were talking about IVs
Sam Kawell  ----->  I was trying to be snarky...
Darren May  ----->  No legacy Machamp for me either. I know I had a few but I probably sent them to the grinder once raids came out and I got higher cp ones
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No legacy champ for me. My first 3 got bullet punch. One of them did have cross chop? But I've since TM'd it. Chase has a stone edge one. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  They were totally supposed to release at least some of gen 4 yesterday. Oops....
Ian Fraser  ----->  Did new boxes roll out sometime last night or did I just miss them yesterday? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  They dropped at 3, which I think was probably when gen 4 should have appeared
Ian Fraser  ----->  You might be right. Wonder if we’d see it today or if we’re now in limbo. New boxes are probably the worst I’ve ever seen too. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm stealing all this theorizing from my computer science brother, but he says the reason they weren't dropped is because of the hp problem with the stat rebalance. If it was just an issue with the game_master file (which is separate from the updates), then they can release out gen 4 whenever they feel like it. But if the issue is how the game reads the game_master file, then we will need to wait for another update and most importantly apple to approve the iOS update. So worst case it could be a few days...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s not what I want to hear 😞
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Welcome to Niantic. Where snatching defeat from the jaws of victory is not just our motto, it’s a way of life. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Amanda can you believe you have more stardust than me? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well the update was just forced on Android and gen 4 gender ratios were added to the master file. Still no stats or moves though
Darren May  ----->  These things always happen when I’m busy so this afternoon or Friday afternoon are my predictions.
Darren May  ----->  Any of these things good before I run out of my office? #onlyplayedGens1&2
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That middle one looks like a turtwig. I don’t know if it’s good though 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Center is grass starter
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They all suck
Darren May  ----->  Well torterra looks cool. That’s probably what I like the least about this game. There is no real attachment to Pokémon/a team like there is in the main series games. It’s just a wave of 6 of the top counter for a raid boss
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wilmore @Darren May ?
Darren May  ----->  Sorry not in my office 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok no worries 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Any interest in Waterfall Mewtwo from Darren/Keaton/Joe? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've got class at 330 :/
Darren May  ----->  Can’t do it either
Ian Fraser  ----->  Same, but I’m in Shelby lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @David Busby @Darren May do y'all need to egg for ultra friends with huckleberry?
David Busby  ----->  Nope
Sam Kawell  ----->  So I just updated my website with the new gen 4 stats and Glaceon is absolutely op. Mamoswine is predictably better, but it really holds its own. This is against Rayray, but he even outclasses Tyranitar vs Zapdos...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  My body is ready for Mamoswine 
Ian Fraser  ----->  YESSSSSSSSS
Ian Fraser  ----->  MY BODY IS READY
Joseph Spalding  ----->  My 💯 Swinub is also ready
Amanda  ----->  Adam Hatcher a perfect swinub today🤗🤗😑😑
Darren May  ----->  Very salty about everyone’s hundos. Also salty about Taylor having a naming scheme for his legendary hundos? Wtf is a legendary hundo? I don’t have any
Darren May  ----->  My one raid hundo is a vaporeon from my first day of raiding
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, the best grass type attacker will be easiest to get now....
Darren May  ----->  Would you rather have no shinies or only ones that you’ve already caught from events where they had their rate boosted?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Have no shiny bc once I get one I've gotta keep it... I'm a horder 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess I forgot to check that exp.... 
Darren May  ----->  Anyone still on campus and want to do davis around 4:30?
David Busby  ----->  Darren you still on campus for a late wilmore raid?
Blaine, E  ----->  @Cindy R  and@Sam Kawell  I believe I level up with both of you today
Cindy R  ----->  You can open whenever you want @Blaine, E 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Could we wait until 9ish? @Blaine, E 
Blaine, E  ----->  Thanks@Cindy R ! And absolutely@Sam Kawell 
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby Sorry bro. Rest assured if I’m on campus after 5 something has gone wrong and I’m not playing Pokémon 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Blaine, E could we postpone the friends another 30 minutes or so? I am lining you up with Hannah for besties tonight, and she is in a potentially long phone call...
Blaine, E  ----->  Works for me, just let me know whenever @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Update: the phone call is still going on...
Blaine, E  ----->  � no rush! I will probably be up late either way
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh yeah, school...
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Blaine, E opening your gift in 2 minutes
Blaine, E  ----->  Good on my end �
Sam Kawell  ----->  just did it!
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Darren May When’s a good time tomorrow to hit bff? I gotta line you up with a few others 
Darren May  ----->  @Ian Fraser I can probably do around lunch or if you want to open sometime around 5:30-9. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  5:30ish sounds good to me @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  Cool, I may need someone to send a buffer gift at 5:25. I missed my exp with pete last night because the notification popped up before I could pop an egg. I think it may be faster now after the update
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don’t think I have a gift from you so it’s up to you when you get the xp. Assuming that’s what you mean. 
Darren May  ----->  I’ll send you one so you can open
Darren May  ----->  Oh hey @Amanda we also hit best today if you could open my gift from 5:30-9
Amanda  ----->  My 3rd best🤗🤗
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You guys mind if I add defib to mystic? He’s been really active during the day. 
Darren May  ----->  @Amanda Could you open my gift in the next 20? I already have an egg going
Amanda  ----->  Opening now
Darren May  ----->  Wow 600k xp in 10 minutes. Crazy
David Busby  ----->  @Blaine, E Go to Kroger NOW
David Busby  ----->  If you’re home
David Busby  ----->  I just got word of a possible hundo beldum
David Busby  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ You and Cindy still in town perchance
David Busby  ----->  The beldum is confirmed 675 cp
Blaine, E  ----->  😱 I am not there! No! I just left! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Can someone get that for me
Ian Fraser  ----->  Hundo is worth a trip back...
Ian Fraser  ----->  😅
Cindy R  ----->  Where is it, still there??
Cindy R  ----->  @David Busby 
David Busby  ----->  It was caught by Parker at 757
David Busby  ----->  I have no clue
Blaine, E  ----->  In a meeting with a school group 😭 @Ian Fraser 
Ian Fraser  ----->  They can all come with you @Blaine, E!
David Busby  ----->  Nevermind the dumbass appraised it in pokegenie at 742 and didn’t post in valor til 757 judging from a screenshot I’m seeing 
Cindy R  ----->  Ugh...
Ian Fraser  ----->  ...well, there’s the dose of disappoint for the night. 
Cindy R  ----->  Totally was going after it.  We happened to have a late dinner with family tonight so was still here 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well that's just cruel
Sam Kawell  ----->  I would have thought he would have at least shared it with valor immediate
David Busby  ----->  I mean you remember we had plenty of hour long timers but that’s stretching luck
Sam Kawell  ----->   *Immediately
David Busby  ----->  Brad told me he couldn’t find it btw 
Blaine, E  ----->  Almost told my team I had am emergency 😅 glad I read this before
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I was trying to figure which 2 wheels the pathfinder needed to be on while Cindy was reading lol.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So close
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Aaww man. What a disappointing appraisal. I hate it when that happens 
David Busby  ----->  Idk pretty sure he just saved a butt load of rares of dust 
David Busby  ----->  And dust dang it 
Cindy R  ----->  @Matt Inger we hit best today.  Let me know when you want to open.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What you got against Sui!? @David Busby 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Show off lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My first hundo from a raid... Might take it to the top some day lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Um...
Darren May  ----->  Um queuing @David Busby
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He’s probably at work 
Darren May  ----->  If I’m being charitable I would say West saw Elizabeth add someone so he thinks it would be ok to add someone too. We have said mods only but Elizabeth isn’t a mod on the team group. May want to update that?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Pretty sure at this point it’s a lost cause. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Nuke the group from orbit. It’s the only way to be sure. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  So. So it’s the I know, but idgaf defense. 
Darren May  ----->  Furthering my point that David has to constantly monitor the chat, other responsibilities be damned. Some fandoms were added once and no one responded quick enough so now he can do what he wants 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He knew it would make people mad. He joked with me about doing it when he got kicked out of big group that time. 
David Busby  ----->  On the one hand screw blacksun but on the other hand it’s gonna piss off taylor
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  .....never mind lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We almost made it a week without drama lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  And again, it involves the suns. 😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May I pointed out to David the last time I added someone that I’m not an admin, but i think he’s afraid I’ll start adding every mystic I meet 😂😂. I won’t add anyone else if you guys think it’s a problem.  
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Change your name to black sun and start adding people left and right lol 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Why’d you have to say that out loud. I was planning on doing just that. @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 😂😂😂
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost I don’t care either way. I’m not sure what we can do as an admin anyway. I agree with Ian that it is probably a lost cause but it just like to see David Dragon emerge from his slumber
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Also I have a bunch of ralts etc if you would rather trade with a true friend 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have so many offers!  The problem is the only one I see regularly is Taylor 🙄
Darren May  ----->  I know. I’ve been re-rolling with snookems but he doesn’t have anything worthwhile 
Darren May  ----->  I guess I will have to pull a Leslie and have a museum trade meetup night sometime 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I have Ralts.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I meet up with her at the library 😂
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I gotta step up my game...
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Cindy R I’m waiting for us to be one day away from ultra...I’m already one day away with @Darren May @Matt Inger and @Amanda so going to try and combo all four with an egg
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Hey guys I’m a little late and have no idea what y’all have been talking about for the last month but I’ll happily kick black sun from the group if you want me to 🙃
David Busby  ----->  Already done lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  David wasted little time with that. 🤘
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Ah, we’re in good hands
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That guy is seriously annoying.  
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Nice to see your still out there @Taylor Pruitt 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Miss all of y’all. My Pokémon go days are more or less behind me but my legend lives on ✊🏼
Joseph Spalding  ----->  This dude’s for you @Sam Kawell 
Cindy R  ----->  Anyone know who this is?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think David added him to big group at some point. Don’t remember his name though. 
David Busby  ----->  Adam knows them I don’t 
David Busby  ----->  Vapor under attack if y’all care 
Cindy R  ----->  Yea, we are messing with them..lol. been feeding it for a few mins..lol
Cindy R  ----->   They are still trying to take vapor...lol
Amanda  ----->  Adam doesn’t know them...
David Busby  ----->  Is that not the level 40 valor he found and added
David Busby  ----->  Or am I thinking of someone else
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I just remember somebody added him and asked if he was PokeWarrior. 
David Busby  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ you care to egg this?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  ?
David Busby  ----->  Aren’t we best next open/interaction?
David Busby  ----->  Yea we are 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I almost forgot to open gifts again. Thanks for reminding me David 😂
David Busby  ----->  Fuck no gifts to see here
David Busby  ----->  I need you to slow down on making new ultra and best friends so I can be best at something other than be a salty asshole 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We,sure our that took forever one sec I'll egg
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ok
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I definitely witnessed you NOT being a salty ass hole tonight. 
David Busby  ----->  Ok I’m opening now
David Busby  ----->  Not gonna lie mr heckles always makes my day 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Do they actually want vapor or do they want the exp?
David Busby  ----->  Still going??
David Busby  ----->  I gotta respect that lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Yep and still berrying. Almost lost it with no service in the way home lol. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm a little sad they gave up. I would have let them have it at,12:01
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Round one of the meats
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yum yum yummy 😋 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If you were going to power up an alakazam, would you choose 96% 15-15-13 or a 93% 15-13-15?
Sam Kawell  ----->  It will make essentially no difference, but since Alakazam has a higher defensive stat than HP stat, the extra 2 IVs on hp would be better than def
Sam Kawell  ----->  But it will really make no difference
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I knew you would say that 😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think even you would agree that either would be way better than this guy that I powered up ages ago. 🤣
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hey at least I gave you an analysis. If you want a more in depth look as to what you're looking at, here it is
Sam Kawell  ----->  Actually ignore that pic
Sam Kawell  ----->  You want to choose a combination that will maximize your total survivability which is a combination of the def and hp (just multiplying them together and dividing by 1000), so here is a pic with the required stat
Sam Kawell  ----->  So if you are powering him up to any level except 40, you will want to choose 15/15/13, but if you are going all the way to the top, go with 15/13/15
Sam Kawell  ----->  Is that good enough analysis?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Gotcha. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  What I don’t know is why I powered up  a 64% when I had these 93% and 96% Abras that I hatched well before I caught that one. I must not have had enough candies to evolve. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Haha, that is weird. Well you made my morning by letting me do that analysis so thanks.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, I realized the 93 is actually 15/12/15 so that might change your analysis, but I already powered it up to 40 so I’m not going to change my mind. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Okay real talk: I know many of you are sitting at 1500 pokes, so what are your thoughts of these people who have basically stopped playing pogo bc their storage is full. They say they don't have any more pokes to transfer and need an upgrade. Are there really 1500 pokes to keep or are they just being lazy
Ian Fraser  ----->  Lazy. If it’s not lucky/max it’s gots to go. Just gotta trade until you get there. See: me with 60ish spots of Gen4 starters that I need to trade before tomorrow. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have some pretty crappy Pokémon that I’ve kept for sentimental reasons, but I was able to get down to 1400 pokes. I have a lot of stuff to trade and that would certainly help. How can you play at all if you have that many?  It’s really annoying to have to check everything and delete right away.
Darren May  ----->  No comment
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Ian Fraser I’m planning to be there at  noon tomorrow if you want to trade some of those gen 4 starters and/or ralts. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  That’d be awesome, I’ll be there early anyway so sounds good! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Wooho. Hope to see you there!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm just thinking about the hard corers that try to have seal team 12's for low man raids. I've tried save at least a team of six of each legendary. Start adding in special limited movies. I don't really have a live sex but for now I can still trim back yo 1150 or so.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Dex...lol....dex
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  But speaking of that if you're trying to do a male and female for possible future breading possibility. 
David Busby  ----->  Yo don’t hit your hundred tomorrow before community day even starts. From 4-5 we should trade high cp low iv beldum in hopes for a good lucky beldum before 5 
David Busby  ----->  That being said I do have several gen 4 starters id like to trade for distance or other gen 4 starters 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :) 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And pumpkin seeds! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yum!  Mine never come out very good (and Kaitlin is allergic to them). 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip Kaitlin and allergy. Just bake at 350 or 320 for like 30 or 20 mins, respectively 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So good
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Before carve
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Michelle U We can be best friends today. Let me know if you want to coordinate. 
Michelle U  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost yes! I was planning to become best friends with Emily around 7 -- would that time work for you also?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That works for me!
Michelle U  ----->  @Blaine, E cracked egg and sent you a gift.@Elizabeth Kidd Yost let me know when you have one running and I can open!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  'I’m ready. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  This is a long shot but anyone that’s ultra with me have an extra Goal Post pass for tomorrow? 
David Busby  ----->  Same lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t get one either. I can’t be there though so I don’t need one. 
David Busby  ----->  I’m off tomorrow and can do it for people if need be 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  What time is it? I don’t have a pass, but depending on the time, i could do it for someone. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  My mom just found this picture of my brother (right) and me (left) playing Pokemon. It doesn't seem like that long ago
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wholesome status: infinity 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Watching out for the bad guys! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Tell em Princess. Go on, git!!!!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well someone is out a day late
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And just when your frustration of hatching tripinch has peeked......cindy and I both hatched a usless beldum after the event.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well it took my casual self three months, but it is done.
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Matt Inger my brother (Rodeo90) has your gift to bring you guys to ultra friends. When would be best for you?
Matt Inger  ----->  @Sam Kawell   Now is good
Ian Fraser  ----->  If I can get together a raid with @David Busby and @Elizabeth Kidd Yost i will hit 40 today.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m done playing at 2:30ish so you may just have to open a gift Ian. Just let me know and I’ll pop an egg. @Ian Fraser 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I might be able to hit a raid this evening. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sad day I was hoping to make it my first Giratnia raid. But that’s okay. I’ll let you know! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's time ladies and gentlemen....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Any confirmation on actual number of players needed?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Could we keep this GroupMe spoiler free for the special research?
Sam Kawell  ----->  And @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ the earliest ones should be hatching in 10 minutes
Ian Fraser  ----->  @David Busby @Elizabeth Kidd Yost you okay if I pop these gifts at this raid at 4:50ish?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Fine with me!  I wish I could do the raid with you!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Does that look about right? Also does DN do ok with /DM instead?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Ian Fraser I’ve got an egg going. Don’t know if @David Busby ever responded 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I actually only need one of you. About to pop 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Popped 
Ian Fraser  ----->  😄😄
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Amanda are y'all around?
Amanda  ----->  I’m about to be on wire rd., but we don’t get good service there now with tmaybe ☹️
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Congratulations, @Ian Fraser !
Ian Fraser  ----->  Guess I got to take this to 40 now...woo? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Perfect Mu2 comes first I think, but I’ll add it to my list 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser yep. You chose a much harder one than I did.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, unless your Ian, Giratina gets significantly outclassed by Gengar, so don't sorry about investing candies
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May Would tomorrow night be a good night to meet up?
David Busby  ----->  Sorry Ian been at work all day
David Busby  ----->  Congrats on 40 tho bro!
Ian Fraser  ----->  All good I figured that’s what was up! Thanks! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Fun fact: I just found out my younger brother has found 5 shiny aron and only seen 171... I ran the numbers and it is more likely to find 2 shinies with 5 seen, than what he has... I think he is hogging all of the luck
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Rip shiny MC. Might trash ya if I catch ya at this point lol.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm avoiding the silph road currently, so does it look like only Giratina Altered is in raids?
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost I might be able to after church around 8:45-9. Is that too late?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No that works. I was going to say 9ish. 
David Busby  ----->  That’s a well fed poke 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I might need candy 
David Busby  ----->  I’m not hurting for candy either 😂 all of the metagross themes for the next two months lol
David Busby  ----->  Also must have got that one from feeding your metagross or my beldum lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So, I know you get three candies if you trade something over 100km, but earlier I got two candies for trading something that was 83km. Never saw that before. 
David Busby  ----->  Yup always been that way
David Busby  ----->  Over ten or 20 I think 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t know. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What do the experts think for my second wave, should I swap mewtwo?
David Busby  ----->  That ice beam or shadow ball 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  SB
David Busby  ----->  Nah that’s a solid second team 
David Busby  ----->  Btw if you’re using sals especially in team one I’d frontload with at least one. Maybe more likely to get two Draco meteors off
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  First wave
David Busby  ----->  Definitely sal then ray then dnites
Sam Kawell  ----->  You'd be better with that mewtwo having ice beam, but I would just go with straight dragons if you have two whole teams of them. 
David Busby  ----->  Whatever you do, do not tm that mewtwo away from shadow ball
Sam Kawell  ----->  Lol, that's not what I meant. Just that shadow ball isn't as good in this scenario
David Busby  ----->  Yea re run your numbers...
David Busby  ----->  I’m getting 20.8 for c sb and 18.8 for c ib
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  11th and 12th for any dragon were lacking 
Sam Kawell  ----->  oops. Totally had snowy as the weather...
Sam Kawell  ----->  Was seeing how op Metagross is
David Busby  ----->  Ooo tell me
David Busby  ----->  Might have to move north 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  Here is neutral DPS
Sam Kawell  ----->  against blissey
Sam Kawell  ----->  It makes me very sad...
David Busby  ----->  Yea he’s my new ray but bulkier 
David Busby  ----->  Why sad?
Sam Kawell  ----->  That I will likely not see snowy weather at all...
David Busby  ----->  Figure out how to make it snow mr rocket scientist 
Sam Kawell  ----->  What would be easier is just hacking AccuWeather
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I couldn't stand waiting any longer. I went ahead and caught the hundo and powered it up as much as jr could
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope to think of a name.... 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Because of the lack of auburn raids we had come back to Tallassee to be part of the most casual raid ever lol.  But as usual huckleberry didn't disappoint 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May You still want to meet tonight?
Darren May  ----->  Sure, I’m about to head to museum. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So since there is still no shiny Gastly, does this imply there will be a shadow claw Gengar community day?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I hope so. I have a perfect I’m holding on to. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got out collecting some mis for trade to help some one out and Jr pulls this crap on his third one.... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😱I’m about to do a mis raid 😬
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've got you some to trade for hopes of a lucky 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wait are people hunting for Mis quests? I haven’t been recording the ones I’ve found but I can start. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Where is that research today?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm posting the north side of campus ones now
Ian Fraser  ----->  Not positive, it was somewhere in my path on campus though...I’ll walk back through in a bit. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Foy, both new stops at the village, pharm marker so far
Ian Fraser  ----->  Actually it might have been that one Keaton just posted at Pharmacy. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All are drivable after 5
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sweet three I can get from the car!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Foy is by car once the gate attendant leaves 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Why are you hunting for mis quests? Can it be shiny?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I want a perfect. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  haha, oh
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  RIP
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  From today alone lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The solar house is a mis quest. I wasn’t able to get it though. Sadly, I think I’ll have to run an errand while K is at TaeKwonDo tonight and I won’t make it out to spin stops. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  New giratina squad. OP
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Couldn't decide between teddyjet and KarKar. Prob rotate them in and out bc neither get much use anymore
David Busby  ----->  Is there a better dark move that ttar could get?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Crunch is pretty much his signature one. I realize everythkng pretty much gets it, but he was the best in gen2 when they introduced dark
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And crunch was as good as it got
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dark pulse didn't come along until the second physical/special split in DP
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well rip gastly community day
Ian Fraser  ----->  That’s a good point...seems like a really really odd choice. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  It really intrigues me how (if?) they will introduce shiny gastly or Haunter.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also a good question...knowing Niantic they’ll probably just forget about it 
David Busby  ----->  F for my hundo gastly
David Busby  ----->  Thank god I didn’t take him to 40
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I took my hundo to 40. Thanks Niantic. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve been pinapping gastly left and right so I would have enough candies to take my level 9 hundo to the top :(
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve had a busy/hard day. This made it a little bit better. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😁
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost I think I’ll name this one after you
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yay!  
David Busby  ----->  New gym out by frat house
Cindy R  ----->  Dang it David!! 
Cindy R  ----->  Race to see if this group can get gold first..lol ?!
Sam Kawell  ----->  It'll totes be me
David Busby  ----->  Rumored second gym out by the bowling alley 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I didn’t notice one while i was at the dentist earlier. Unless it changed sometime after 4pm
Blaine, E  ----->  The one on opelika rd?
David Busby  ----->  I guess so
David Busby  ----->  Go find it!!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Has anyone checked the Starbucks by Eagle Statue yet? 
Blaine, E  ----->  😂 I was hoping I could see if from my house, which I see the bowling alley stop but no gym!
Cindy R  ----->  Hmm..sounds like we will be exploring tomorrow. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Dont tell Cindy be we need to egg our best friendship tomorrow 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Keaton Rhea 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It has begun!
Cindy R  ----->  Those victories and treats tho...glad I have a stock pile of golden razz. Lol
David Busby  ----->  Well I took it with straight storm. Didn’t even try to keep the gym. Just dropped 40
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I see us all sitting around it continuously battling it
David Busby  ----->  First time around I had both Parker and hunter drive back by and drop in. When I was with jazzy and co Parker dropped back in but we never saw another car 
David Busby  ----->  Also apparently deore was yanking my chain about a second new gym. That would’ve made me too happy anyway 
Ian Fraser  ----->  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/9re019/gengars_day_raid_should_be_a_tier_4_raid/?st=JNPXFOE6&sh=61a169e2

So Gengar might be T4 much like other special raid days. 
Cindy R  ----->  Yall come drop in...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I wonder who would be out in the rain battling it for 30 minutes
Ian Fraser  ----->  Starbucks is still not a gym. RIP my hopes and dreams. Once again. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So who is excited about Psychic!?!?!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So the only real reason to participate in Gengar Day is to get a shiny. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hatch 5 tichneor
Ian Fraser  ----->  Should we not be working for Chansey anymore? 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  For anyone interested t3 pops at bee labs 1115, still 2 spots
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean it will prob still b a top defender. Just won't be God tier anymore 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, blissey will still be the number 1 def just by a less considerable margin
Darren May  ----->  @Ian Fraser Is there a time for waterfall?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Not specifically. When the people at Parker are done basically 
Darren May  ----->  Ok I’m omw 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I can do waterfall but i just parked at IM fields 
Ian Fraser  ----->  They on the way @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Ttar at Davis?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I can do dat
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can do jr. I'm kinda done with ttar on main
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Omw from broun
Darren May  ----->  Ok omw too
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Me 2
Darren May  ----->  Rumors of lick as a second exclusive move for gengar. That’s good right?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Amanda hi
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May yep. It's basically identical to shadow claw
Sam Kawell  ----->  And it's basically been confirmed. Pokemon go hasn't tweeted, but Niantic support has
David Busby  ----->  There still spots at bee lab @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Would one of you kind people be willing to spin a gym and catch one poke for me tomorrow?  We will be camping and there are no gyms at the Boy Scout campground. 
David Busby  ----->  I probably can but might need a reminder lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well I didn’t know how busy you’d be with the wedding. 
David Busby  ----->  Yea idk what time I’m supposed to be there 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You might want to find out dude. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So I hatched this little guy 
David Busby  ----->  Crap guess that means I shouldn’t rely on using two passes tomorrow 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Hey I can do that for you tomorrow if you want @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sorry @David Busby i actually had a little work. Amanda filled the last spot
David Busby  ----->  Gym still up then I’m assuming?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yes
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’m in it, but driving home. Wont be able to keep much of an eye on it tho
David Busby  ----->  It goes down I’ll try to take it out 
David Busby  ----->  But I got wedding stuff today and tomorrow 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Apparently there is a raid at bee lab
David Busby  ----->  Ooo what is it 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  My distance seeing powers not working right now lol
David Busby  ----->  Check nearby raids it should show you if you remote viewed gym?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Haven't stalked a gym in a while forgot that worked.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’d be great @Ian Fraser!  Thanks!  I’ll dm you my login info. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Uh oh. Somebody serious about taking it lol. May not be able to hold it much longer. Not a bad run though 
Amanda  ----->  I think it may be Anthony.
Amanda  ----->  Adam was just home from lunch. If it’s not now it will be later.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’m almost home, so just @me if it needs any berries
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Was that you someone just berried too lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm about 6 in on Cindy now 7
Amanda  ----->  Me.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Not me. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Just got home so lmk when you do your last berry and ill take over
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Amanda's berrying right now. I can still berry from mine in Cindy. I may have to work some more after break lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I might be down to 4 left yo berry on Cindy 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Joseph Spalding if your able you might can berry long enough Cindy's account might be back in play
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Im gtg now
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Fuck they got her
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  They double tapped Cindy out
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think they brought reinforcements lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yup. By the time i hit it. Gone
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Hit my limit on chansey
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ @Amanda 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I can do a couple but have to work 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I think it may be will. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm gonna go ahead and dump some berries and take latter maybe lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Me and amanda left
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I erred out and they got me
Cindy R  ----->  I have to say...this gym is hilarious!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Do we know what’s in the research boxes for next month yet?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't think so. They didn't announce it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well the stamp reward encounter I don't think has been said
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, if @Ian Fraser cant do your spin catch, I can help you out @Elizabeth Kidd Yost . I prob won't play but can run over to Sam Harris when I do my dailies 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I will prob do it at 7am or so tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If needed
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thanks!  Ian’s going to do it. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Anybody know who this is?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope. Need to find out! 
Blaine, E  ----->  Went to add to arb when there were 4 spots and then all of a sudden it was nearly full 😅 @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ @Cindy R 
Sam Kawell  ----->  It'll be Shadinja
Sam Kawell  ----->  ....
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So, should I get another suicune on the 31st or wait?
Sam Kawell  ----->  I would say wait bc we know suicune is bad, but who knows how they'll do Shedinja
Cindy R  ----->  @Amanda my niece said who is that crazy lady staring at me...bahahha
Amanda  ----->  😂🤣🤣🤣ME😁😁😁
Amanda  ----->  That lemonade pie is good.
Cindy R  ----->  She said I thought she was just excited someone could see you through the window. LOL
Amanda  ----->  She really thought I was “special”😂😂
Cindy R  ----->  @Amanda @David Busby yall in aub?
David Busby  ----->  My car might be a little distinctive lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Toss me in there if you need @David Busby 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Pls don't turn into Valor y'all
David Busby  ----->  I foresee gold with less than a day defended
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You know we can't be falling behind lol
Amanda  ----->  The difference a raid makes
Cindy R  ----->  Man, we will have to try to hit one over the weekend
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The guy at the tent next to us is cooking bacon and eggs and boiling water on his camp stove.  We have pop tarts and an electric coffee pot. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Camping?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yes but you prioritized the important part!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Glamping
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, this is the Boy Scout campground; it’s not exactly the caliber we would normally pick. 🤣
Cindy R  ----->  This is the perfect time of year!  We are long overdue to do a camping trip. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That’s the truth. This year will be my  middlest daughter’s first time and I can’t wait. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If the ground wasn’t wet from yesterday’s rain it would be perfect!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Did you say glamping......ya that's probably a better description of what we do lol. Our tent is only a 10x20.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Everybody is calling ours the McMansion. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh my gosh, we have that same tent...
Cindy R  ----->  Ours doesn't have a a front porch..lol 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ours has half of a front porch bc a windstorm broke one of the poles.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh no!
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea There an easy spot for me at Sam Harris?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Uhh idk
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes 3 open 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just me and Shelly 
Cindy R  ----->  Spots at Bee lab
Michelle U  ----->  @Cindy R I hit ultra with huckleberry today. Do you guys want to coordinate gifts? 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Michelle U need to get some stops will you be play this after noon?
Michelle U  ----->  I'll be on a plane from 4-6 But can do anytime outside of that. If he just needs a gift I can send it
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'll chat you when we get out and about
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Michelle U are you still able to run an? If so let me know and I'll pop one for huckleberry as you open gift.
Michelle U  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ sorry did not have signal earlier.  Just landed and can egg whenever you are ready
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Actually you can do it now,got 12 minutes on his egg. Hope your trip went smooth
Michelle U  ----->  It did Thanks! Ok I cracked an egg and sent him one! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  At Cornerstone Church
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Anybody want a pass for Felton on Tuesday?
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’ll take you up on that @Elizabeth Kidd Yost !
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sent
David Busby  ----->  I also have one. And probably will need someone to do for me
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I got you covered bby
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I forgot to share these... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, let me know when you want to hit best @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  ... But don't let Cindy know about that empty exp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Drift loon op with one battle won 
Darren May  ----->  Yeah Bertha Jr. got her first battle won there today too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ open gift whenever. Just tag me so I can swipe to gift
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea he said 5:30 sound good?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Works for me
Cindy R  ----->  Enjoy that xp..lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Speaking of empty xp, were due for besties tomorrow @Cindy R 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  We’re*
Cindy R  ----->  Good, I wanna be like keaton..lol

What time works for you?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Any time after ~9am
Cindy R  ----->  Does 4:30 work?
David Busby  ----->  @Cindy R Y’all gonna be poking at bee gym tonight?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Keaton Rhea you ready...and @David Busby no we had to cone home today 
Cindy R  ----->  We poked for a min this morning but they were feeding early!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Go ahead and open @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  4:30 is perfect 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Do you have gift? 
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea he is opening now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok good thanks
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Has manta not seen any drat wursts today?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  * bot and *quests 🙄
Keaton Rhea  ----->  None today. Just a bunch of rares
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I did not have time for south side of campus
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I can’t even do those bc I have two drat quests from yesterday 😞
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not gonna lie.... I deleted two drat quests this morning for the rares.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only spots left for bot to check is lower quad and amp and the stops along Samford near aiac. Most of the others were checked by some one else. 
David Busby  ----->  Spots bee lab @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was gonna swing by there earlier but I ran out of time. Still don’t even have the badge 😞
David Busby  ----->  Must have caught pseudo in class 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Winter is coming! Make sure you are prepared 
Blaine, E  ----->  @David Busby  he is at the Bee Lab gym?
Blaine, E  ----->  well regardless someone is lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think that’s what pseudo meant @Blaine, E 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Hey...anyone wondering how he knew we were talking about exactly that in Mystic? Did someone dm him? 
Blaine, E  ----->  Yeah I am watching it, I don't get how he is kicking people out though. He knocked Ian out and he was the third to place and I never saw his health go down
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Probably because someone is berrying. He assumed it was David. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If he uses all his accounts, he can take it out without a chance to berry versus most defenders
Blaine, E  ----->  Well I also accidentally fed myself a regular berry...so there's that � He will probably get the gym soon
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I hate it when that happens 😂
Cindy R  ----->  @Joseph Spalding you can open whenever ..running an egg
Cindy R  ----->  @Joseph Spalding I have 8 mins left on my egg.
Cindy R  ----->  If we cant make it happen today we can tomorrow 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ahhh. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Cooking dinner now
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I sent you a gift, so open it whenever you like @Cindy R 
Cindy R  ----->  My egg is over, can we try again tomorrow?  I am heading to a ballgame.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Open it at your convenience tomorrow 
Cindy R  ----->  Ok, I will tag you 😊
Amanda  ----->  @Ian Fraser What IV checker do you use?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nowadays I use Pokegenie, but I used to use one for iOS called Pokerater. 
Darren May  ----->  Lavender town music is back! Finally!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip my go plus :(
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh no! 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Lost, run over or worn out?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well you might want to rush and get a new one. I heard that Niantic has stopped making them bc they want people to buy the pokeball plus...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yup. They have discontinued them and the only option this moment is the go-tcha
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Also, rip!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lost it somewhere on my way to lab the other morning 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  🙁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell what is the pokeball plus? 
Amanda  ----->  The switch accessory??
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh does it work the same? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Tons of stupid videos of it but I'm too lazy to watch those
David Busby  ----->  Ive heard the pokeball plus is stupid big though
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I just saw that 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Defib just told me it’s not. It will fit in your hand. 
Amanda  ----->  Go-tcha is kewl 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm not a fan of auto catch. I like to check what it is b4 I click. Although it would b the same thing if I'm driving 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You can with gotcha 
Amanda  ----->  That’s what I do. I turn auto catch off
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The pics and video I watched makes it look pretty big 
Amanda  ----->  So I check before so click.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But there is no button correct? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or there is a button 
Amanda  ----->  There is. It just isnya raised button
Amanda  ----->  Isnya...nice one auto carrot
Amanda  ----->  It is not raised
Amanda  ----->  I turn vibrate on when I don’t have auto catch on too.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hmm I might have to look at that then
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The button is really sensitive though. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And the arm band is ooogly
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  How much are they?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And how are they on batteries?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The gotcha is rechargeable 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Day to day, weekly, or if your @Keaton Rhea will it last half a day?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I charge mine every 2 or 3 days. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  My complaints with the go-tcha are the previously noted oogly band, and that the GUI was written by a blind tibetan monk. It seriously, is one of the worst things ive seen. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  GUI?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Graphical user interface 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The people I’m with are smarter than me and told me 😂
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It appears they have replacement bands in diff colors on Amazon. No idea of the quality 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So you might want to wait on the gotcha. Apparently Niantic is “cracking down” on them bc they are against the tos. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip
Blaine, E  ----->  "Rip" - @Keaton Rhea 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  In pharmacy just now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I definitely mass transfered that right b4 you sent thay
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I need it too! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It was my first perfect egg @Keaton Rhea !  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Glad you got it! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Also, why is poke genie putting in my Metagross for Gengar?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Probably for survivability? It usually favors that over DPS. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mu2 is best bet for most movesets tho
David Busby  ----->  Someone run the numbers on zh/mm gross for gengar
David Busby  ----->  Tsr had it being pretty good 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  When does Tina raids end?
David Busby  ----->  Oh nevermind then 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It would be a good anchor.... but it takes SE VS shadow ball. Steel no longer resists ghost or dark
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If it's sunny, groudon is a beast achor
Ian Fraser  ----->  Will you need an anchor? The birds weren’t even close to needing one. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  For duo maybe. SB hits hard off gengar high atk
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And it's a two bar. If using only SB mu2 maybe
Darren May  ----->  So should I Tm my psycho cut mewtwos just for this?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Birds have piss poor atk/moves in general. Gengar has bad HP, but it's boosted bc the raid (all T4 are at same value) 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes and then tm them back right after
Ian Fraser  ----->  Uhhh do you not have a stack of like 60+ fast tms? I’m going to use mine just to clear out bag space lol. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  PC is only better when your charge move (SB IB or P) are doing more dmg. It's good EPS
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But since C is SE its way better DPS
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If you run FB and SE, PC is pretty much always better 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If C is SE, then C is always better
Darren May  ----->  @Ian Fraser I do but I’m a casual and don’t want to put in the effort
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The chart is more for duo attempts
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Trio is gonna b stupid EZ
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Fun fact: my level 23 shadowball mewtwo with 13 attack has higher DPS than my level 37.5 Metagross against Gengar 😂
David Busby  ----->  So who in here wants to squad up?
David Busby  ----->  For gengar day 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ll have Kaitlin with me so we’ll probably just do the free six. 🙁
Joseph Spalding  ----->  SQUAD UP FAM!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Also, in. 
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea You run into kentoo at your playground?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol no. Don't know that guy but he likes shiny crow too
Darren May  ----->  I would also like to do the 6 free ones if I can get out of any football related obligations 
David Busby  ----->  Idk how you missed him he dropped in two minutes after you
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I had terrible service in Auburn last time so I may join the Opelika group. Plus I can’t keep up with you guys!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Y’all I was trying to catch Joe’s deoxys yesterday and Kentoo kept trying to show me stuff on his accounts. I focused just long enough to find out if his 100 mewtwo had shadowball. 
Cindy R  ----->  @Joseph Spalding are you where you can pop an egg?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Good to go. Egg is popped. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby i miss understood early. The shiny crow is not kento. They took gym solo lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Kento just filled it up after
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ We become besties when I open your gift. Let me know if you want to coordinate. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Maybe I can shoot for 2 for. I think @Darren May and I hit tomorrow. 
Amanda  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Best. Friends. Tomorrow. 🤗🤗🤗
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost @Darren May do y'all play early at all? We get to auburn about 6:50. Can y'all do eggs then?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I can. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->   @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  Should I open or are you eating to hear from @Darren May 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  *waiting
Darren May  ----->  Im available. Let me know when to pop egg unless there is a raid on this side of town we can do 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  My egg is running do @Elizabeth Kidd Yost you can open
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Darren May i think we're going to try t5 here at bee labs in 10
Darren May  ----->  I’m on foot so I can’t make that. You can open my gift. I have egg going 
Cindy R  ----->  2 mins until egg pops..but spots at bee lab.
Darren May  ----->  So should I get a suicune or a shedinja today?
Ian Fraser  ----->  I think the answer is Shedinja? We know Sucicune is pretty bad but we don’t know how they’re actually implementing Shedinja. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I accidentally claimed my suicune yesterday. Just standing there talking and my finger hit the button and I heard the noise in my hearing aid so RIP but at least I was able to do research yesterday 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I just claimed mine and got suicune
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It won’t change until 3. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If I wasn't a casula I would have remembered that lol. Trying to open on an lucky egg and forgot
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve done that before too. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm ready for 3:00
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Sam Kawell DONT OPEN BOX
Ian Fraser  ----->  It’s a moltres atm
Sam Kawell  ----->  I have seen way to many failed releases to do anything at 3
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes it's fixed now
Sam Kawell  ----->  So I can do it?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. Chase just did his
Darren May  ----->  Samfor is now an evolve 2 pidgey quest and I only have 1 pidgey. The suspense!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hype! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I bet it gives a pidgey encounter 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Something something a bird in the hand...
Sam Kawell  ----->  His circle is really red
Darren May  ----->  I evolved a pidgeotto and it didn’t count
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I think it's like 2% like legendary catch rate
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I miss the rare candy quests already... :(
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Maybe we’ll get new ones. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got over 100 total (including raids) in the week
Darren May  ----->  Reward for evolve 2 pidgeys is caterpie encounter
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only used two premium passes I think too
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It could be shiny!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dat shiny
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Cool
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You get a crap ton of poke balls when you hit that middle goal. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Just checked the game master file (cause I'm a nerd like that), and Shedinja has a 5% base catch rate.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So annoying hard to catch on something that can't run
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Basically just waste time throwing balls 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m lazy and impatient; I usually use an ultra ball. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I know, I doubt it, but this is such a horrible way to introduce Shedinja that they must have some reason for it or something happening soon that will explain all of it. If they had done something cool with his ability and packaged him out as research breakthroughs or made him useless and easily accessible it would have made sense. But making him useless, but claiming he is cool enough for breakthroughs? It makes no sense...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I use ultra and pinap. I've still had it take over 20 balls to get in on curve excellent 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or just get him when you evo a nincada like in main game...... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or evo with spare 50 candy? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Or if they want him as a research reward, make him come from a normal research not the breakthrough.
Darren May  ----->  If you have the larvitar quest the catch rate increases exponentially with each successive excellent throw. True story
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess it is better than the Regis. I thought they were next 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea I think AdvSync logged from the past couple days cause I’m at 25km walked too. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It must have. I wonder when the week ends?  
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost With 35km walked currently in the lead? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No. Keaton has 36. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Mine changed though. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also apparently that walking is for nothing. I feel so judged. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Keaton Rhea If you just never leave the classroom I might get my 6pm canceled 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks Amanda! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  #KarKarisCasual
Amanda  ----->  Catching up still😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Trying! Slow your roll Amanda. I can only do so much when I'm 'botting' for quests
Blaine, E  ----->  I know I should know this/ probably have been told 100 times, but the ghost event is over correct? so the rare quests are gone?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yep. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I miss them already. :(
Blaine, E  ----->  So those 3 rare quests I grabbed earlier are useless because I didn't grab enough duskulls or shuppets �
Ian Fraser  ----->  But for some reason ghosts are still in the raid rotation, so if you still want to chase after that shiny Shuppet..
Blaine, E  ----->  It isn't meant to be for me
Ian Fraser  ----->  If you have have the candy I have lots extra to trade you
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ditto
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E i have some left over 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Haven’t cleaned out my box for the night yet
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think... Might of just mass evo... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr should have a bucket load too bc he was the pack mule
Blaine, E  ----->  I only have enough shuppet candies for 1 evolution, and I have no duskulls to check candy, but thanks for the offers!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay that’s way more than I have 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll dump it all on u to get the quests done! 
Blaine, E  ----->  I mean...I would happily accept them � I did have to walk ALL THE WAY to samford for one of the quests
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes so far.... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  How else are you gonna get to 50km for the week? 
Blaine, E  ----->  yeah it's embarrassing how much it says I have walked so far...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May Have you decided what you’re doing tomorrow?  West posted a raid route for Opelika but I don’t want to go alll the way to the other side of Opelika just to do six raids. I’d rather do the ones closer to downtown. 
Matt Inger  ----->  I’d like to meet up for a few if possible.  
Darren May  ----->  Not looking good for me right now. We are having friends over for a tailgate at our house. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Bummer Darren
Darren May  ----->  I was proud of myself for weaseling out of going to the game but then “we” decided to do a tailgate. Our preacher plays pogo and will be there so maybe he can convince my wife to let us leave for a few. Pray for a miracle and cell service!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  From what Brad says, you, Matt, and the kids can probably do it yourselves. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You guys can
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm gonna try duo with me and Jr. Rip for SB 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Trio is stupid easy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Me and Jr r going for broke. If we can't duo then I don't get one
Darren May  ----->  I’m sure we have the dps to do it. Idk if we will get to go or have phone service 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well I don’t know what we’re doing yet. i really don’t want to go all the way to the other side of Opelika but I got zero service in Auburn on moltres day. Couldn’t do half the raids. 
Blaine, E  ----->  If anyone wants, I have an extra pass for Goal Post 11/6
Ian Fraser  ----->  Hey guys, I found a Pidgey! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yaaaas. Ca-caw 🦅 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Darren May snookems is you right? I was going to take Duncan but will leave it 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Snookems is his sons account
Darren May  ----->  I mean I just dropped in there for him. Creepy
Darren May  ----->  There are spots at Duncan though
Darren May  ----->  I mean Bowden 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  According to okie genie I would lose with one second left. I suppose if K actually had revives we could duo. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Or am I reading that wrong?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ttar houdoom and ray are above the duo line eve at lvl 40
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Does she have more alakazam or espeon? Those are below the duo line. Or psychic (and obviously SB) mewtwo
Keaton Rhea  ----->  5 of ur six is under the duo line
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  She has two espeon but they are not powered up. And she has 4 revives. 🤣
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  She has mewtwos but they are also not powered up. We aren’t going to try to duo. I was just checking for fun. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh ok then ur good
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This is the trash I'm dealing with
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just hope no SB gengar raids in my duo..... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May What cell phone provider do you have?
Darren May  ----->  Verizon 
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost How many devices do you have? Things aren’t looking good for me right now
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve got one extra. 
Darren May  ----->  Do you want to use my account if I can’t get out of my house?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We are going to meet up with Matt Morgan and his family so we should be good. But if you want me to do some for you I will. 
Darren May  ----->  Ok I’ll let you know
Matt Inger  ----->  Where are y’all meeting?  I really don’t want to go to east Opelika.  
David Busby  ----->  I’ve got a crew starting at museum that will do 10-15 auburn gyms then head to opelika if you wanna join us 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We’re meeting at the Tiger town bench at 12:45 I think. The plan is to do TT, then the two Pepperell gyms and then downtown Opelika.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Full disclosure - I believe Leslie is going to join us. 
Matt Inger  ----->  Thanks y’all!  David, I’m going to try and meet you guys at the museum.  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Just to double check, ultimately we want lick and shadow ball on these gengars right?
Darren May  ----->  Yes
Darren May  ----->  Unless niantic does some shenanigans 
Cindy R  ----->  Good luck guys! We are sticking to Tallassee todaybsonwe raid raid and then back to packing. 
Cindy R  ----->  *so we can raid
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Snookems and I will raid with you guys in opelika. Should be there by 1
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip
Cindy R  ----->  So close!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got closer on the other 4 attempts but missed screen shot
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh well I tried
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Are you out of town?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I failed, then we came back to Opelika and I filled all of those
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You could have joined us goof ball. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So should I go ahead and tm these guys to shadowball or wait?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean I evolved plenty
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I only had time for a few attempts
David Busby  ----->  What gyms you fail at in opelika I can sign in and do 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I could bring you my iPad if you want a second device I’m just at Tiger town
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Library, the two downtown next to bread pub 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And that one church that I don't remember name of 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm already home 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You can do it if you really want but I kinda don't care either way. It was just fun to try duo
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sam Harris has 55 mins left. Does that mean it's tier 4 with tier 5 raid timer?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell ?
Sam Kawell  ----->  I really don't know. If it was legendary, then that would be true, but I don't know bc it should be teir 3
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean I can duo a tier 3
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought on these days the raid timer didn’t start until someone viewed the gym or something like that. So if no one viewed the gym until 2pm it would have a 3 hour timer starting at 2. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I really don't want to waste pass on it if it's another t4
David Busby  ----->  Yo me and joe can help
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Help us help you!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Eta? 
David Busby  ----->  Like 20?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Funks might of failed st mikes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Based on big grewp. U could stop there and do it first if needed 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Pass
David Busby  ----->  How long on st mikes 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I think it’s over
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No idea
David Busby  ----->  Passing Shelton mill on university so 5-10 out?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm here
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Almost there
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Storm just lefg
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Left
Keaton Rhea  ----->  1/1 on jr shiny
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks Joe and David! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I evolved my two hundos  should I evolve anymore really quick? How many gengars do I need?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea ??  @David Busby ??!😠
Keaton Rhea  ----->  One at most lol. 6 if you running large grewps. They are wet paper towels. 
David Busby  ----->  I have 28 if you need some 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's always good to get trade bait too
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t mean to post angry emoji. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gengar is kewl and all... But right now it is not the best thing to invest in now
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I got one more in just in time. Stupid phone service sucks right now. Our WiFi is down and I had to come outside to get a signal. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Glad you got it! 
David Busby  ----->  Two off the plus in the space of like 5 minutes 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I never claimed this. I guess it just does it automatically?
Ian Fraser  ----->  So yea, I was meaning to ask about that. I think that you can only claim one reward per week...maybe in the future it will be automatically awarded. Because my journal has no record of the 50km reward being given and my dust amount hasn’t changed enough 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I hit claim after I got 25km. I guess I shouldn’t have 😫
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Three off the gotcha while i was putting gas in the truck. 
Cindy R  ----->  Dang...we have been semi casual today.  How long are pinsirs spawning like this?  
David Busby  ----->  Today and tomorrow 
David Busby  ----->  @Cindy R Can I give you login?
Cindy R  ----->  I caught it about an hour ago..was just checking catches 😢
David Busby  ----->  Ok well I do expect that to be a level 40 rhyperior when it comes out then!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  My house catch is not as good as yours @Cindy R ☹️
Cindy R  ----->  Yea, definitely not the norm..lol. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t think I’m the only one looking for beldum candies. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mm meat salad
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Steak, walnuts, goat cheese, grape tomato, balsamic vinaigrette 
David Busby  ----->  Candy Chaney Kroger parking lot
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Blaine, E you're  the last one in here...
Michelle U  ----->  Lol! But she isn't far behind ! 
Blaine, E  ----->  Congrats @Michelle U 
Thanks for the update @Sam Kawell 😅
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You’re close though @Blaine, E !
Blaine, E  ----->  40 isn't going anywhere! I will get there eventually 😁
Michelle U  ----->  At least sams update was more relevant than Leslie's.... 😆
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Lol now we're all stalking her friendship just to see what she's doing each day. You can definitely thank Sam for that.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And now I gotta go look to see what Leslie said
Ian Fraser  ----->  Mentioning being the last one in here, I went through and realized a couple weeks ago I’m the youngest one in here. Maybe I should change my tag to Youngster Ian..
Michelle U  ----->  Or make your pic a baby Pokemon 😃
David Busby  ----->  Togepi or riolu
Ian Fraser  ----->  ...but my current pic is pretty kick ass and I haven’t gotten much mileage out of it. 😅

Plus I have to hatch a damn Riolu first. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I might be the oldest 👵
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But still going at heart! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Still young **
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And in maturity 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm by far the oldest person in my lab. Surrounded by young children like Ian
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m not sure how old you think I am with comments like “young at heart”. Most people are surprised when they find out my age. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Like me. Especially when I take my hat off. 😂 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was just joking with you. I can't tell anyone's age honestly. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, congratulations @Michelle U !
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I heard they are increasing the lvl cap to 45 today
Blaine, E  ----->  😑
Ian Fraser  ----->  Along with the storage increase right? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  And a battle rework
Cindy R  ----->  @Matt Inger I just got a goal post invite from your wife's account. Thank you!!!!   I wasnt sure if she was on group me or not.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Does anyone else need a pass for Felton?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I mean Goal Post 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I could use a GP pass. 🖐 
Matt Inger  ----->  @Cindy R You’re welcome!   She’s not on GroupMe.  She and my son don’t really play much anymore.  
David Busby  ----->  I don’t have one but I also can’t be there to do it 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Thank you @Elizabeth Kidd Yost got it. 
Blaine, E  ----->  😍
Ian Fraser  ----->  Like it’s great that I’ve seen twice as many Marowak as Ponyta but...can we not? 🙃
Ian Fraser  ----->  *cubone
Amanda  ----->  Look how pretty when it’s a Rapidash
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  How long are spawns increased?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Joseph Spalding Bee lab under attack
David Busby  ----->  I think all three of us berried on that lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It was too low!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  They’re back. David’s our
David Busby  ----->  That was a definite double strike
David Busby  ----->  Should I drive back out?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It was at one hit and I never saw it go down
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Im three berries in on mine
David Busby  ----->  It sat on two forever for me. Should have just pulled the trigger
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Definitely multiple attackers
Cindy R  ----->  I wish we could help.  We just haven't been able to play much these days. 😔
David Busby  ----->  Y’all moving though right?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Hit my limit 
Cindy R  ----->  We are packing like crazy.  Fingers crossed we close the first week of Dec, then moving! 
David Busby  ----->  Y’all need some help and I have an off day to actually help let me know 
Cindy R  ----->  Will do!!  Thank you! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh well, they got us this time
Blaine, E  ----->  Anyone friends with other jin? If so how close is he to 40?
Blaine, E  ----->  Thanks @Joseph Spalding !
Cindy R  ----->  Spots at bee lab...thanks @Michelle U 😊
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just a light breakfast. One serving
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So Manta bot is an idiot and thought he could beat the rain
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip
Sam Kawell  ----->  A pretty good start to my Tuesday!
David Busby  ----->  Yo what’s up with your cubone candy
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't do nearly as much catching as shiny checking anymore. I actually couldn't evolve him as soon as I caught him and had to wait to catch a few more...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  A million stardust and No candy....so sad.
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m at 128 Ponyta seen since yesterday..
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I got one of each shiny today 😍
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Good thing we are getting extra dust. I was getting low 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  🙄
David Busby  ----->  I was just thinking do I preemptively blow everything?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t have very much to blow 🙁
David Busby  ----->  Y’all obviously don’t remember how much dust I used to keep 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I guess there are freezing temps somewhere for me to go plus this. This morning lol.
Cindy R  ----->  Spots at bee lab if any of yall want to jump in.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well it looks like my morning commute is my shiny charm!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Poor metagross is hangry. Might starve to death bc of how few berries he gets
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Somebody will want it lol.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Apparently bee labs is still popular. We were under attack for almost 2 hours lol. But it was under attack when we got there. Instinct was in the gym and we were the only ones in sight. Gates were still locked. So is there somewhere you can reach the gym from inside?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yay!  Now I have the family 😁
Darren May  ----->  Do we know when this ponyta/cubone event ends? No shinies here even though I’ve heard the rates are boosted 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nope no clue 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No idea but I'm betting 3PM today based on length of other mini events
Ian Fraser  ----->  This has already been longer than Wingull/Pinsir I think 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I expected it to end yesterday at 3PM
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip my shiny cubone
Darren May  ----->  I got spoiled by pinsir since I got a couple of shinies on the go plus just from going to the store and church. Caught a lot more cubones and ponytas with nothing 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got one pinsir but just one pony on main and one on jr. Shiny checking like mad for all of them 
David Busby  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ I’m almost positive there’s a low level valor that works in bee lab. I had two battles won within 10 minutes several times
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’ve about given up on shiny pony. Life is pain. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got this instead of a cubone. I don't even want this trash
David Busby  ----->  Massive salt wave from Daniel incoming 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I don't even need a shiny lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only 1523 seen
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry for the bad language. But that was my first shiny back in 2017 and I can't bring myself to change it bc the new filters... 
Cindy R  ----->  I think @Keaton Rhea is rubbing the salt in the wound Bahahaha 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well I'll trade all of them except the one with a nice name lol
Cindy R  ----->  Oh @Sam Kawell let me know when you want to open gifts. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  At this point I think my account maybe more rare for not having one lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well if you are ever tired of waiting I've got you one! It will cost you tho.... Big time. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not one but two pidgey! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Cindy R I'll let you know. I'm trying to line it up with a couple ultra friends.
Cindy R  ----->  Sounds good...no rush. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I haven't tried but that's funny
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We are all waiting... 
Blaine, E  ----->  😱
I'm trying! no friendships for days so I'm having to work hard for this last 800,000...😅
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  ☹️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip pony and cubone spawns
Blaine, E  ----->  😜
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Blaine, E have I been sending you gifts?
Blaine, E  ----->  on and off - we are 12 days away from ultra@Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'll make sure I'm a better friend �
Blaine, E  ----->  Thanks! 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  High lvl trash IV beldum kroger parking lot on dean
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Aw thanks!  Not out that way unfortunately. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I did finally get enough candies to power up my 98 to level 40 but I have another I could be working on. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also the candy farm is back up at Sam Harris. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess it's more of a lotto bc you lose pretty much every time haha 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was so disappointed when it was taken this morning. I was making a lot of progress towards gold!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Will took it so I'm wondering if he is going for gold
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Had a thick 33 CP pidgey in there 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr got a lvl up too
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Now beldum is the new tripinch  😕
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  At least hatch me a perfect 
Blaine, E  ----->  Preach 🙌 all the 10ks I have hatched after community day have been beldum (-1 that was a trapinch)
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Cindy R I'd like to wait until tomorrow to open your gift. Do you have a particular time you would prefer?
Cindy R  ----->  Early around 6:45 - 7ish...or after 4:30 if that would work for you.
Sam Kawell  ----->  That would work for me, but I'll check with the other people. That's not super early for me lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I haven’t hatched any beldums since cd, but I did get this from David the other day 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Cindy R I can't get it contact with one person until tomorrow, so let's say 8 pm
Cindy R  ----->  Ok, sounds good
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sitting on my couch. So weird. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That has been happening since I got my new phone. It’s also the reason I keep hatching eggs at night when I’m already home and have to get alolan eggs. 
Darren May  ----->  When is the last time someone caught a ditto? Lathe stop is catch a ditto for 3 rares 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Really? Dang. I’ve caught a couple over the last few weeks 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yesterday for me
Sam Kawell  ----->  This morning at my house lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I caught one this morning about 20 mins before I found the quest
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think it was in the village lot
Michelle U  ----->  @Darren May pidgey at thach hall is a ditto 
Ian Fraser  ----->  ...I think I just go plus’d that..
Darren May  ----->  Got it and the nincada too. Thanks @Michelle U!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Do we know that Ray Ray is coming back to raids next?  Someone mentioned it today but it was the first I heard of it and I can’t find anything about it online. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Cindy R you ready?
Cindy R  ----->  Go for it @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Just opened it. Did you get it?
Cindy R  ----->  I will pop an egg when I open the game.  We just left a football game and grabbing dinner.
Cindy R  ----->  They won their Championship Game....one excited kid ❤
Cindy R  ----->  Spots at bee lab
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  There's a gengar raid at bee labs 41 minutes left just fyi
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I forgot to share this catch this morning... Ready for the salt party
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Free to a good home! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I thought this was another shiny today, for a second there. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Salt levels were off the charts for a few milliseconds 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No it's a new one
Keaton Rhea  ----->  .... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The other was 10 cp
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  But just one today right?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh yes I misunderstood 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Dang, well I'm jelly. I thought I was cool for catching a larvitar and bagon in the same parking lot.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Heck yeah!
Sam Kawell  ----->  My first chance at a 3200+ blissey!
Darren May  ----->  Power it up quick before they reshuffle the CP!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh yeah, I'll use all of my 26 candies. That's why I said "chance"....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Will it stay the cp or will they just drag it down like they did gary?
Darren May  ----->  Walked her >300km to power up and evolve and now there is no point
Sam Kawell  ----->  Blissey gets nerfed big time
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well it'll still be the best defender by a good margin, just a smaller margin than it is now
Sam Kawell  ----->  But still definitely worth an investment
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  But but but....
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m not putting anything into my blisses or chanseys until after the nerf. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Also there is a duskle raid at bee labs for us desperate folks
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  17 minutes left
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m not that desperate. I did do a sableye raid at Boykin yesterday though. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  22 more raids til gold
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I can’t believe I got it so low!
Blaine, E  ----->  Are these the level 40 secrets everyone talks about?! 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nah it’s just 20 lucky eggs 
David Busby  ----->  Spots bee lab
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Keaton Rhea does Jr need to egg for ultra friends 
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby I made you my proxy if I win the raffle. Have to leave since my daughter is melting down 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He would appreciate it. He his ultra with you and huckleberry 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ are you running an egg on both of them? 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Yes
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You ready
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes egg is on
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You should have gifts from Jr on both
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks! 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Bee labs pops 5t in 7min
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  2 spots open
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Taylor getting a little too sassy this morning 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like him but he can't be trying to cause problems in Mystic chat
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He’s intentionally trying to trigger David; I’m sure of it. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. I think so
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, since apparently pogo thinks I’m in the eastern time zone even though my phone is on central, I was able to claim my adventure sync rewards already. I didn’t get any eggs :(. Just one rare candy and stardust. It was close to 3000 stardust but I worked hard to make sure I had egg spots open 😔
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :( boo
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Any info on the next legend?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm trying hard not to spin a stop b4 9
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've not heard anything. We can always pray for Mr Ray ray
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Was he trioable?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Taylor keeps telling me that Rauquaza  has been confirmed but I can’t find that information anywhere. 
Darren May  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ Duoable under the right conditions 
Ian Fraser  ----->  We have 11 days left on Giratina I think. Also I’m pretty sure we have to have a major update coming this week for Let’s Go launch, which is...soon? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve also heard that dialga or palkia are likely. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  What does huckleberry need to power up?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think the top counter is still ray VS ray
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But dragonite, latios, or Sala work too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My guess is it's either palkia or dialga
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And articuno right?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  No idea what those 2 are but what would be needed for those?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  They are gen 4 dragons. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Articuno doesn't do nearly as much damage as the three dragons, but it is tankier. Only really use it if you're low on dragons
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Awe. But I want to use my perfect 🙁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean I've been using my celebi and mew for Tina some. Use what ever if you have the numbers to easily beat it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll use the one with sentimental value when ever I can
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  These days we short man raids when ever we can. Even got a little up rising of Tallassee players.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Are the new and celbi at least super affective or are the decoration?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  SC DC mew. C and DG celebi 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So about as super effective as I can get. DT is better than SC prob. But SC is still SE
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I got a 10k!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Jealous 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm going to b sad if it's shinx
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m salty
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It could be shiny though. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes true. I guess a shiny would be cool. But I want a riolu
Ian Fraser  ----->  Why can’t the stardust reward even be good. :( I can catch 15 Pokémon by just walking by Haley. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The dust reward should b back to 3k. I mean it's a full week so not OP
Ian Fraser  ----->  ...Wasn’t it 15k originally? That’d be more in line with what I’m thinking. How useful is 15k dust really? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I thought it was just 3k per tier. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean I've spent tons of star dust on non meta mons so 15k is worthless too
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought I got 3000 but when I checked my journal it was 1500. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  They should at least give you the amount you would get from the egg. Isn’t it 2000 from a 10k?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sounds right. You can get 5k-ish with the current event + starpiece.
David Busby  ----->  Upwards of 9600 with starpiece off a 10k
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I forgot to mention it, but im stupid jelly of your shiny shelder hatch. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like I am a green jelly bean 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I would never evo it
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I wouldn’t evolve it either. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I need that caterpie too. Gonna b a metapod forever
David Busby  ----->  No the cloyster just has that super pretty blue 
David Busby  ----->  I need both tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess the blue is ok, but the orange one is way better. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess most ppl know where I stand on colors.... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Shiny Cloyster looks too much like the regular one. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Besides, the shellder is close enough to Auburn colors to keep it that way. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  iOS only update. Changes a bunch of gradients + the icon for the PoGo+. Doesn’t seem like much else. Doesn’t stop the AS crashing on iOS. 
David Busby  ----->  I think this update fucked some stuff up. Used to be when I typed in defender and checked gyms it would back me out to the same defender search. Now it doesn’t. I’m also having a lot of problems remote viewing gyms 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Look at this sucker actually updating his game before Niantic forces him to. I don’t trust them to push an update w/o breaking something. 
David Busby  ----->  I swear they forced me to. I got your message and was at museum and pokes just wouldn’t load at all. And I’d just started a star piece 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Not forced for me. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I haven’t had a problem...aside from the constant AS crashes.
Ian Fraser  ----->  He means forced as in game wouldn’t work. 
David Busby  ----->  Yea I had to go to App Store and force download. The game just wasn’t working for me 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Bug "fixes"
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Bug betas is how Niantic rolls. 
David Busby  ----->  If I open groupme or another app I have to restart app before I can click on or view defenders it seems. Fml
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Joseph Spalding  ----->  F
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Any idea when it is going to be?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr will finally have the dragons he needs to stop being so bad
Sam Kawell  ----->  I hate to burst everyones bubble, but that is a fake trolly twitter account. The real account is @TheSilphRoad
Sam Kawell  ----->  Those buys post fake news all the time
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ew
Sam Kawell  ----->  *guys
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I wanna green dragon! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Meeeeee toooooooo. Nooooooooo!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Soooo cute!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If @Keaton Rhea was on here and @Cindy R update hers y'all would be in the top 20
Blaine, E  ----->  mystic represent!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm just a pleb! 
Darren May  ----->  Are 1 & 5 Anthony’s parents?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Almost certainly. They have more catches than him irrc
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ i believe @Amanda has the most exp from a Mystic in AU. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wait, Anthony’s parents are Mystic?
Darren May  ----->  Yeah his dad’s player name is craigish so that has to be him
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would like see a F2P list too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes they are both Mystic. Main reason Anthony did not want to b Mystic 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Wasn’t his main account his Mom’s alt?
Darren May  ----->  What’s the leaderboard for the jogger medal look like?
Ian Fraser  ----->  My head cannot wrap around a world in which Pseduo is Mystic lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think you are right Elizabeth. He didn't get all of the exp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She is beating me bad! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip my med exp too after I prestige for a third time... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Y’all are going to laugh at me but I just got my 24th gold gym at Vapor Craft 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don’t even have that many gold so no hate here 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Darren May i don't think they've included the jogger yet and @Keaton Rhea what is F2P?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Free to play. Aka he hasn’t put any money into the game. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  They talked about that awhile back. I'm not sure what a realistic exp would be to claim F2P.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm pretty sure your dropping some bucks to break 100mil lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean he could probably hit 100mill in a year and a half? 2 years to reach 50 mill + friendship bonuses..
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm free to play. Outside of gift cards, go plus, and opinion rewards 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Once I updated I'm between 21st and 26th on all boards. So I'll claim my spots.......till others  get listed lol.
Cindy R  ----->  Really...
Ian Fraser  ----->  CP rebalance coming tomorrow!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I got a solid 3 weeks out of him
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well it’s about time!  Is snorlax gonna be nerfed as bad as blissey?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Pretty bad, but not as much
Sam Kawell  ----->  The big HP pokes are going to be nerfed, while the glass cannons will get a boost. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  The hope is that this is making Blissey less OP from a TDO standpoint in preparation for PvP
Cindy R  ----->  Whew, I have work to do..barely made top 20.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  �and now im just 27th
Ian Fraser  ----->  Has this person been around before? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve never seen them. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Never seen them either
Ian Fraser  ----->  Trading makes it next to impossible to assume spoofing, but I was just wondering.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean I would trade something dank for one lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Me neither
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I only really value a handful of pokes anyways so it's just a dex entry. I'll give away a lot of things if friends want it enough 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oops overshot it a bit... 
Darren May  ----->  When your Blissey is about to get nerfed but Scizor gets a buff.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Update just got forced on android
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I don't see much diffetent.....yet
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They prob won't do anything until 3
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They will do it server side
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looks like we will get new boxes soon
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The candy factory at Sam harris is blue again 😆
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I finally evolved one of my shiny eevee from CD. Not disappointed at all! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You finally got one!  I’m waiting to trade with Tom once we are besties for a sing vape 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Shiny vape
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah I was just a big pansy. Should of done it earlier
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well hello...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  At least some nice boostage happened. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  3000 plus cp champs 
Cindy R  ----->  This is the saddest thing I have ever seen!  My poor blissey went from over 3200 to beneath an arcanine in my line up..LOL 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hey now don't hate on arcanine! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Once again RIP my Glaceon dreams.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
David Busby  ----->  98 sneasel, hundo togetic that I probs don’t have candy for, or maxed 98 rhydon first?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Don’t think it really matters so I’d say Togetic
Cindy R  ----->  I just hatched this...now half sead?
Cindy R  ----->  *dead
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m not even mad that’s impressively bad lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes Cindy. It's a bug
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It can be healed but I think I restart (could b wrong) fixed it 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She is ready... Some trade might happen soon. I sense it
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  By By stardust. Been maxing for 45 minutes but worth it. Now find these damn special items.
David Busby  ----->  Hatch?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Back yard catch a few weeks ago
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Maybe only the 3rd perfect since scanners
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Anyone found a new special items or are they gonna be 7th day spins?
David Busby  ----->  Research breakthrough
David Busby  ----->  If you haven’t missed one get yours after midnight 
David Busby  ----->  Also @Cindy R blissey is one of the few blisseys pre nerf
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If I can stay awake lol
Darren May  ----->  Just golden razzed a blissey that is still in a gym to see that sweet CP one last time
Darren May  ----->  Also got this on the go plus this afternoon 
Cindy R  ----->  😢
Joseph Spalding  ----->  F
David Busby  ----->  I’m trying to keep her in as long as possible
Joseph Spalding  ----->  �
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Seems like they been coming through about 10:30pm
Darren May  ----->  Also my maxed 98 milotic is now 2999, which is driving me crazy
David Busby  ----->  Who is it y’all have been taking out in the am? @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Jazz and crew 
David Busby  ----->  If him, cbcollins, or slooby drop first most nights we need to watch for the double shot. Narcolepsy doesn’t double shot I don’t think
Cindy R  ----->  Jazz has been the first one in the last few mornings.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I meant to get over there this morning but I didn’t make it in time. Figured I might as well work on getting gold at the frat house 😂
Cindy R  ----->  I'm just glad we stopped running into Pete every morning..lol
David Busby  ----->  The worst thing about Pete is hell just come back in an hour. Every. Single. Time.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We are worried they will put up a no parking sign where we have made rutts in the grass.....3 days of rain
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Under attack @David Busby 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Not as op as Cindy’s 
David Busby  ----->  Let me know when to take over @Cindy R 
Cindy R  ----->  They seem to have attached twice and stopped.  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s part of their trickery. I thought they had stopped one night and then bam! We were out. 
David Busby  ----->  Ok when/if you need me to take over don’t tag me. Just post in here or dm cause if I switch out of pogo I have to restart. Starting my watch now lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well benadryl is kicking in. Maybe they went home lol.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yay!  I got gold at Sam Harris. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Just for @Amanda 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Probably a pretty useless way to use my first Sinnoh stone, but now I have a shiny dusknoir
Sam Kawell  ----->  And I will always think of Rhyperior's neck as his mouth so it looks like he has a big toothy grin
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Might have to change his name to 2 faced
Darren May  ----->  Does anyone need the Felton pass for next week? Snookems and I both have the pass but we will be out of town
Ian Fraser  ----->  Day before thanksgiving right? 
Darren May  ----->  Yep
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ha that’s a no for me. 
Darren May  ----->  Dis any good?
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Sam Kawell My first gen 4 will probably be this bad girl here, so. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  “Kaitlin” leveled up yesterday!  
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m so proud of all the work she’s put in to get to there 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser  well she will be questionably the best grass type attacker!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  How is it going? 
Blaine, E  ----->  😁 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yay!  Welcome to the club @Blaine, E!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I think I'm ready for Bagon CD!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, just hatched 5 10k and 2 of them were bagons. Yay!
Ian Fraser  ----->  I evolved my 93% before Giratina and I’m thinking I might live to regret that..
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes Ian gets it! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Maybe I just like liking stuff. 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah ur definitely the Sabi here
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No one else even comes close
Blaine, E  ----->  🙄
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I would actually say Keaton is the Sabi here. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ We’re ultra frands when you open that gift on buckaroo. Lmk when to pop an egg. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So is anyone's Meltan research not working?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Mine seems to be working fine. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  How many steps are there?
Sam Kawell  ----->  My text is all computer language
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  But I can read the steps
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So is mine
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Don’t know why those are out of order. I can read the tasks but I can’t see how many steps there are. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I can see the tasks in the first step (catch 10 pokes, spin 5 stops, transfer 5 pokes), but usually it says step 1\6 or something at the top and I can't  see that
Sam Kawell  ----->  Were you able to see his intro schpeal?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->   Nope
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well this is the saddest first shiny post ever
Sam Kawell  ----->  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/9xq6d0/shiny_magnemite/
Sam Kawell  ----->  Read OP's comment...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Blaine, E congrats......or.....about time lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  At least she beat DeoreDX. Somehow. 
Blaine, E  ----->  😂 thanks @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ ! I also had a lot of help getting to 40...😅
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Took decades but she made it... 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  There for a minutes.......huckberrry....lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sorry about being a bad friend last few days but.....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Huckleberry will never hit 40 like this
David Busby  ----->  Not sure whether or not I’m saltier at you or Parker rn 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Do you think they accidentally swapped out Anorith for Kabuto? I just don't see how Anorith makes sense for a Kanto event...
David Busby  ----->  Someone was posting about the dex entry for armaldo says he can cut up steel with his claws. So evolve an anorith to armaldo so he cut up meltan for research?
David Busby  ----->  Kinda made sense to me 🤷‍♂️
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hmm, that seems like a stretch, but it at least makes some sense
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think they messed it all up. I mean even the quest names are wrong
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It seems like they had to release it today and they just shoved it out the door
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  https://v.groupme.com/39263023/2018-11-16T22:55:45Z/49fe8686.640x360r.mp4
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Last one
David Busby  ----->  @Keaton Rhea with stat rebalance jolteon would be a harder solo than before correct?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  HP is a set stat
Keaton Rhea  ----->  For raid tier
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think he got a small def nerf
David Busby  ----->  Also freaking rip for me using sinnoh stone on sneasel instead of 40 rhydon
David Busby  ----->  I thought defense was changed to?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E pls share
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes defense was only nerfed correct @Sam Kawell ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  None was increased 
David Busby  ----->  Hmmm ok
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or was it buffed. Idk I don't remember 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think some might have slightly been increased, but I'd have to check
David Busby  ----->  I really wanna be able to solo every t3 ever 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Don't trust me without me looking some stuff up 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok wrong. Def buff. HP nerf. Except fat pink
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So jolteon is now more impossible 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  His base HP sucks
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think it's the opposite
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But he gets it buffed hard with raid being fixed value
David Busby  ----->  He could always be done in sunny with 40 groudons
Sam Kawell  ----->  Def goes down but ho goes up on all but high HP pokes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh right. I read chart wrong
Sam Kawell  ----->  When I get home I'll explain why with math for those who care
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sam is right. HP goes up on everything but fat pinks. HP up. Doesn't matter for raids tho 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So easier, but prob still needs sunny
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I recall a specific % (like 20%) buff in HP and same % nerf in def in most pokes. Except pink 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I'm assuming you are referring to this but he isn't done yet! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I wanted to see progress! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And I see zero. Get back to work
Blaine, E  ----->  I have a raid pass and pokecoin shortage...getting to 40 wiped me out! Will definitely be a couple of days 😆
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The work never ends
Ian Fraser  ----->  Not gonna lie I was actually excited for Kanto spawns because I assumed that would mean Ryhorn...silly me 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Nope. Just Anorith
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm a hoarder and only have 702 anorith candies.... Not right 
Blaine, E  ----->  How can you live with yourself?
Sam Kawell  ----->  So, mathy explanation time. As most of you probly know, in the main series, each poke had a physical and special attack and defense stat. To simplify Pogo, they combined the physical and special into a base atk and def. Before the nerf, they calculated base atk as:
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It is truly a struggle...
Sam Kawell  ----->  atk_pogo = something*(7/8*high + 1/8*low)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Is something a 'normalize' and high better atk and low worse atk (sp or normal) 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  From main series 
Sam Kawell  ----->  sorry, I didn't mean to send those yet
Sam Kawell  ----->  sorry:
def_pogo = something*(7/8*high + 1/8*low)
where high and low are the higher and lower of the physical and special defense and something is some scalar that I don't remember. When they reworked the "CP", they changed the equation to:
def_pogo = something*(5/8*high + 3/8*low)
Most pokes were either specialized in special or physical, so this balancing of the two stats makes for a decrease in defense. Apparently balanced pokemon get a boost with this, but I would have to look at some numbers to see if they actually increase their pogo defense
Sam Kawell  ----->  to convert the main series HP to pogo, they used the equation:
hp_pogo = 2*hp_main_series
(don't ask me why they added that 2 multiplier). After the rework, they changed it to
hp_pogo = 1.75*hp_main_series + 50
If you remember your algebra, this decreases the slope of the curve but adds in a constant 50. So pokes with low hp in the main series profit from the added 50, but tanks like blissey get hurt from the decrease in the slope
Sam Kawell  ----->  I can illustrate the hp thing with some graphs. Give me a second
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The 2* I thought was for gym defender only. Not all pokes? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gimme some sexy pics lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  So the blue line is the pre rebalance equation and the red line is the post rebalance equation. The lower axis is the HP for pokes from the main series games and the right axis is the HP converted to PoGo. AS you can see, if a poke had low HP in the main series, then they get HP boost, but if you get into the higher HP pokes, they get nerfed.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mm it makes sense
Keaton Rhea  ----->  HP in main series never translated well either. It's very nonlinear bc you had a defense stat and special defense Stat. One is almost always good, other bad (unless ur a defensive poke) 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Go can't account for that as well with CP calculations 
Sam Kawell  ----->  yeah, CP really isn't that useful. It is really just for the newbs and for making you feel good about yourself
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I just rely on my research in base stats and smogon back in the day from hand held game calculations. I know most of what to hit on normal or special side
Keaton Rhea  ----->  CP is a waste of time. It's DPS, TDO and T2W
Sam Kawell  ----->  What game just got released?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well hey there!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ampitheater is catch a dragon quest for a dratini 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Are you serious....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Well well well, temperature finally got cold enough LOL 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought that was gonna be a Magikarp!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  A shiny one!
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m pretty sure this reality will just coming to a grinding halt when that happens. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I've caught many....many carps while at the beach too.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😔
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Can you get a shiny from out of a trade?
David Busby  ----->  No
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No
Sam Kawell  ----->  No
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I guess if you could we'd all be trading 100 a day
Ian Fraser  ----->  No
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ian just couldn’t be left out 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  I figured fourth time was a charm! 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  �and then your alt ones up you.
David Busby  ----->  Oh I’m not sure if I shared in here but...
David Busby  ----->  Four shinies today 😁
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You suck....lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  Damn Fortress looks lit 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  None since cd 😢
David Busby  ----->  This is far and away the most shiny luck I’ve ever had
Ian Fraser  ----->  I have seen two non boosted shiny since Wingull weekend. Also no Ponyta 😥
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Fite me. None in two weeks. 😢 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You didn’t get any Cyndaquil?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Nope 👎🏿 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Double nope
Cindy R  ----->  This is my souvenir from the weekend.
Sam Kawell  ----->  #SpooferDarren
Sam Kawell  ----->  I don't know if @Darren May has this chat muted
Darren May  ----->  It’s legitimate. I’m at the “happiest place on earth”.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would catch the ugliest shiny as my only shiny for this event
Ian Fraser  ----->  It’s not perfect, but a good start to the week. 
David Busby  ----->  Ooo shadow ball
David Busby  ----->  I’m also way too happy that I just hatched a budew 😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I would be happy too!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yep. I might see if I can get him to give up his 3k SB one too...

But yea Budew is probably the cutest baby. 
David Busby  ----->  Togepi and shiny wynaut would like to have a word with you
David Busby  ----->  Munchlax too
David Busby  ----->  But yes budew is easily top 5
David Busby  ----->  Wait does this person not play anymore?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nope. Him and I hit ultra and then he stopped lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  Idk have you seen Budew’s animation? 
David Busby  ----->  Ok that’s true. But I identify with munchlax on a spiritual level
David Busby  ----->  Oh god I forgot riolu is technically a baby. And happiny is adorable. So are Elekid and magby and now I can’t make my mind up 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Shiny budew for the win! Munchlax isn't that cute.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ooooh them’s fighting words. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t believe anything he says. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ugh. My app has crashed 5 times while I tried to open gifts.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sabi Jr 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Thus bothers my slight OCD lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser @David Busby can we get to besties tomorrow morning at 7?
David Busby  ----->  Yea I probably won’t be awake by then but if everyone else your trying to coordinate with wants to do it then whatever 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May @Blaine, E ok to open gift for jr for exp in the morning? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'll tag you so you know to put an egg on when you open the game whenever you wake up
Blaine, E  ----->  Yes @Keaton Rhea 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I won’t either but I can swipe to egg lol. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Sam Kawell 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m not sure if this will appeal to your ocd or make you crazy @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
David Busby  ----->  So I’m not a fan of this whole not being able to spin stops thing 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Me either
Sam Kawell  ----->  ?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Why? What was the deal?
David Busby  ----->  I need my guaranteed shinx/riolu egg 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ohhh, I thought there was a bug or something
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And i guess been to casual to keep up lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So we need to walk 50 miles in 7 days and then have an egg spot when you collect??
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve got two open egg slots for tomorrow morning. If I spin stops I might get an egg. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, 50 km @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ but yes you’ve got the idea. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Did I see it mentioned what time on the 8th day....does it matter as long as you haven't filled your egg spot correct?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  9am on Monday 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And it’s just a chance for two eggs it’s not guaranteed that you will get them. 
David Busby  ----->  Got my 50k I can go home now 😊
Cindy R  ----->  Spots at bee lab
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May @Blaine, E im going to try to egg jr at about 8:30 after I get to work
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr is gonna skip like half a lvl on empty exp
David Busby  ----->  Does anyone remember when everyone thought I was crazy for bringing up empty xp?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. How could anyone forget. That was only talking about raids too
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I got almost 700k this morning lol. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr's first best! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Amanda  Any chance you can open the gift I sent you in the next 27 minutes? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think she’s at work. I saw her there earlier. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh well RIP. That’s what I get for not messaging her last night. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  No regrets. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Max it! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr got 650k exp off one egg this morning....
Ian Fraser  ----->  Maybe after I max my Giratina lol. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  How many more days for giratina? I  need a few more candies my self.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Till the 23rd I’m pretty sure 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought it was the 20th
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yep you’re right! 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Dang I don't think I can get 134 candies in a day.....by by rares.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I just got my first Giratina on Saturday....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ did you get a hundo? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There really isn't a reason to power one up (unless there are special circumstances). It's not good in this form
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I do 1 of each ledgary if I get a high IV to the top. Not the Regis 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Maybe one day ledgary only gyms 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Only a 98 @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ah OK. I used to take one of each to 30 but I stopped doing that now. Rares are too precious 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Rares and stardust burn holes in my bag. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't raid enough and I gotta always max those myticals
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Stardust on other hand, it grows on trees and is free flowing as far as I am concerned 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm thinking those mythical maybe next
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They so OP
Keaton Rhea  ----->  *sarcasm *
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I can't seem to stop myself when I get an high IV and CP lucky....i feel obligated to push it to the top.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Told Cindy to stop trading me carp..lol...one day gyrodos needs to be back in play.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And now I wonder if anyone's EVER dropped 20 gyrodos in 20 gyms......
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You should do it, @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Screen shot each one and then post it haha
Amanda  ----->  @Ian Fraser Sorry just got off work.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Totally okay! Was my fault for not tagging you last night lol 
Cindy R  ----->  Anyone ran into this? Won't let me sync to it. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Did you got to settings and enable it?
Cindy R  ----->  I went to setting and click on adventure sync and get that error.  I dont see any other way.  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Are you on iPhone or Android?
Cindy R  ----->  Android
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think you have to have the google fit app?
Cindy R  ----->  Daniel just clicked it and his worked..I will see if downloading that helps.
Cindy R  ----->  Ugh..that didnt seem to work either. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  It's not Pikachu!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Jelly!
Cindy R  ----->  Uninstalling the app seemed to fix it. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ll trade you @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'll pass, I like me a shiny cloister
Blaine, E  ----->  Feel free to remove my sister 😑 she got a shiny I don't even have yet 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought I saw that she got that!  I don’t have one either. 😥
Blaine, E  ----->  She didn't even know what it meant for it to be different 😂
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Casual bonus strikes again. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wait, did she pinap it?
David Busby  ----->  Sam with the real questions
Blaine, E  ----->  Oh I have no idea. She is young and reckless so I wouldn't be surprised.
But her stardust would make even the biggest hoarder jealous 🤷‍♀️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell im stupid jelly of your catch!
Cindy R  ----->  Spots a bee lab
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea do you want me to get to ultra with Jr today?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I say just go ahead when ever. He only has 2 eggs so he is going to save them for bests 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Cool. Would you mind sending me a gift....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes one sec
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr OP
Blaine, E  ----->  Very flattering reflection 😅
Ian Fraser  ----->  Who knew Jr had glasses! 😂
Blaine, E  ----->  He's gotta see 'em all! 🤓
Joseph Spalding  ----->  And the future. 😁
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So are we back to using ttars??
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ttar, Gengar, SB Mewtwo I bet
David Busby  ----->  Weavile OP
David Busby  ----->  Honchkrow op 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Basically Mewtwo team again...
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Ok stat pros, does it look trioable? Probably gonna try the first one we see.
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m not one of them stat pros but here’s someone asking about duo:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/9ywgh7/can_cresselia_be_duod/?st=JOQ9D44A&sh=009066c7
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Finally. A use for the super sweet spiritomb and honchkrow!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Happy Birthday @Joseph Spalding !
Cindy R  ----->  Aww...happy birthday!!! @Joseph Spalding 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ whenever you open my gift we lvl up! Let me know if you want to coordinate please
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well finally took my hundo guardados to the top. Hope he'll be relevant in PvP
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Happy birthday @Joseph Spalding @Blaine, E maybe tomorrow afternoon we can egg up to hit ultra friends with both of you.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I keep thinking about taking mine to the top @Sam Kawell. But there are just too many other things that need it more. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I feel i should just drop gyrodos every time in hopes niantic puts them back towards the top. They did get a little cp boost.
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Amanda could you open my gift whenever you get the chance?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Okay seriously tho
Blaine, E  ----->  Guess you won't be needing this anymore thanks to next community day @Joseph Spalding but I will save him just in case 😂
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Correction, community days. 😞 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  And I still want him. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Blaine, E 
Blaine, E  ----->  Well he's all yours!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Count me in for the trade!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wait, I just read the post more clearly and they are giving the PAC region their event on Sunday and everyone else's on Sunday!!!! They assume they can't fix whatever problem they will have so they are making a new section of the world Guinea pigs.
Ian Fraser  ----->  “We can’t fix this so instead we’ll rotate who gets screwed” 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I think that should be some Niantic moto
Sam Kawell  ----->  Just re-read my post:
*Saturday
Blaine, E  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  are you able to do gifts now?
Cindy R  ----->  @Blaine, E he can open now...say when your ready
Blaine, E  ----->  someone was trying to coordinate with me, but then stopped responding -_- will let you guys know, Thanks!
Cindy R  ----->  Ok, we are on hwy 14 and service can be spotty...will keep an eye on the chat
Blaine, E  ----->  if he wants to wait we definitely can - no big deal either way
Cindy R  ----->  Just sent you a gift..you can open whenever. 
Blaine, E  ----->  thanks!
Sam Kawell  ----->  So Hannah hatched her first eggs today so I got my most rare level 1. I never thought I would have a hatched level 1, but boy am I happy.
David Busby  ----->  Well spinning a gym puts you at level 2 I believe 
David Busby  ----->  So that’s pretty damn rare 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Happy Thanksgiving everyone! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gonna catch me something good!..... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Are you just burning an incense for the fun of it?  
Sam Kawell  ----->  Parents or in laws?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  In laws
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is 'down town' in the direction I'm facing
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm wasting the incense while I cook the turkey
Sam Kawell  ----->  I actually can see a gym from my in laws which I a big step up from Hville
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My house in HSV is like 3 or 4 near by with grass. No stops in sight but I can drive to a church in like 5 to 7 mins
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Closest gym to my house is  ~5 miles away and littered at the top of a mountain. 😢 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not the prettiest I've done but it smells and tastes good! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  My two turkeys say happy Thanksgiving! 🦃 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Keven is smoking ours Keaton!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Sorting in reverse!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also with Friends!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would love to smoke my turkey too Elizabeth but it would require for me to move it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've done it b4 and it's a pain
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Who is ssj4 Greg? Must have a really high power lvl to be ssj4
Cindy R  ----->  My little pile of cuteness...Happy Thanksgiving  everyone!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Aaaaand it's Christmas!!!
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser a terrifying possible after the Shedinja precedent
David Busby  ----->  Aka I’m screwed 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I know. I've been saving some shiny Eevees....
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That would be sad 😢 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Hell hath no fury like a Glaceon scorned 

But I don’t think they would something like that. They’re not introducing a new base Pokémon, Eevee already exists. And in theory we have to be able to use the name trick, right?

I would be super peeves if that happened but I doubt it 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I agree, just the flippant and uncreative way they gave us Shedinja scares me for future things
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It boggles my mind how formulaic AND chaotic Niantic can be at the same time. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Just a small indie company doing their best 🙄
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’d expect a little better of a Google internal startup. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  But alas, Niantic has proven my expectations are too high. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Take that back @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ !
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Your right it needs mostly chicoritas lol.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Anything but chikoritas.....
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I only got two shiny chikoritas but I’m ok with that. Bring on the larvs, beldums, and drats. 
David Busby  ----->  Hi
David Busby  ----->  Can’t set my damn phone down around jazzy even at work 🙄
Blaine, E  ----->  I was going to guess Ross, but Jazzy makes more sense haha
David Busby  ----->  Ross came by like five minutes later lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeeesssss
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This is fun. I love old things
Ian Fraser  ----->  So what was in style back then!? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All sorts of crazy things. Ads for shag carpet. Very odd colored flooring for the kitchen (bright green and blue). Flooring tiles that you can 'do yourself in just an hour'. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Single color themed bathrooms (avacado green, salmon pink). Colored toilets. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Full house tours. Like a Pic of everything in there plus the floor plans. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Man, colored toilets is something we need to bring back
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Phrasing @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hahaha, how do you know that's not what I meant......
Keaton Rhea  ----->  An elite women's club
Ian Fraser  ----->  Avocado green bathrooms are basically my dream. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  When I was a kid we had an avocado green refrigerator and couch. The couch went to the basement when we got a new one so we had it for years. 
David Busby  ----->  Volkswagen van in tie dye colors. Bonus for footprints on the ceiling 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  Where the good Pokémon at? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is what my nearby looks like! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Was that a blazing saddles reference @Ian Fraser ?
Ian Fraser  ----->  I wish I was that clever 😥
Keaton Rhea  ----->  By the way, there’s a drat quest at the Samford tennnis courts  - thanks to Elizabeth! Just in case you did not see
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I just copied pasta from other grewp
Ian Fraser  ----->  Is Larv quest even still in atm? I’ve scanned through for the last three days and seen nothing. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think so but it is just very rare
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser in sure it wasn't the shiny you were looking for, but congrats!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Snitches get stitches 🧵 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My shiny for the week! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not spoiled at all.... 
Blaine, E  ----->  Mine aren't either 🤷‍♀️ (ignoring snap text 😅)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Definitely a kwazy kat lady
Blaine, E  ----->  I accept this 😹
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Blaine ^
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lights! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That was fast. It’ll take us two days to put all the ornaments on our tree. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Team work! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  3 young (I guess) bodies hanging them. Then Carroll's dad watches us and helps us fill it in from a distance 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We need a ladder to hang ornaments at the top and my young people get bored easily. 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was ladder man today
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've got height and reach. Not much else going for me
Sam Kawell  ----->  We did ours yesterday!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We’re usually a little further along by now but all we have on ours is the star! It’s kinda sad. Not sure how much we will put on it this year with the kitties
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We got in a Grove. Ours at home goes up right b4 Thanksgiving/right after bc we want to enjoy it. Always set up in laws during Thanksgiving. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My parents are never home for Thanksgiving 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell looks awesome! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  My family always sets it up the day after Thanksgiving
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We normally do it day of but had things to do this year. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I agree it's best to do early 
David Busby  ----->  I might be a grinch but Zoes is playing Christmas music pretty much every other song and i hate it 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like very nice music. Just as Blaine or Michelle 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's very family friendly 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not metal at all
Ian Fraser  ----->  Live pic of Keaton
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is wholesome compared to my mind...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But thank you
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The two radio stations that I toggle between both started playing all Christmas music last week. I like Christmas music but it’s best enjoyed after Thanksgiving. And there are only so many Christmas songs, it’s easy to get tired of it. 
Blaine, E  ----->  Yeah your music is like a lullaby...😅
But also, Imma need you to dress up as death Santa for Christmas, you are half way there with the beard! @Keaton Rhea  
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yaaaaas. Satan Clause Manta!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  🤟🏼
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Slight correction:🤘🏻
Ian Fraser  ----->  Was it a correction though? Or your true feelings all along?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It’s Schrödinger's Correction. Simultaneously both and neither. 
David Busby  ----->  What about schrodingers errection?
David Busby  ----->  Just open the box and you’ll know 😘😳😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Our tree will be questionable as we're trying to move on the 8th. Usually we @Keaton Rhea like that extended tree enjoyment too since we go through all the trouble.......you know 11/22 ish to valentines day lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think a lot of ppl would be afraid of me if they actually knew the music I listened to. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I do think I would make a great metal Santa tho! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I feel like I need a playlist from you and Blaine because you two have me intrigued. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I think you’d be surprised @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Idk if that is what you really want @Elizabeth Kidd Yost . Sometimes things are better left unknown haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If you are super curious, steal Blaine's pandora. I might of corrupted it with some new stuff 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  When I was 4 my favorite band was Black Sabbath (my brother may have had me brainwashed) so I’m not scared of metal 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ha this is a few steps up from sabbath... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Maybe I'll give you some songs later haha
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh Blaine sent me a list. I’ve never heard of any of it 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Most of them are foreign 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea How many besties do you have now?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  All of them
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only 33 I think
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I get two more tomorrow 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've slowed down
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Been around there for a while
David Busby  ----->  Oh man
David Busby  ----->  34 with one more today
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  35 with one more today 😜
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :/
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've got the frands I need. Now I've gone anti social haha
David Busby  ----->  Ain’t no one in auburn got more than us though I don’t think 
David Busby  ----->  The three of us probably have more than all the casuals in big group combined
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Leslie only has 13
David Busby  ----->  Honestly 13 is a lot fr
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Why do you care so much?
David Busby  ----->  I don’t? It’s like bragging about battles won and pokes caught
David Busby  ----->  I just wanna be the best
David Busby  ----->  Like no one ever was 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes the very best frand
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Dang if Leslie has 13 I'm just sad lol. Not sure if I have 10.....but.....i am working toward 100 gold gyms and 100 level 40 pokes. 
Cindy R  ----->  Yall made me go count..only 21 best here.  2 more as soon as we open and several more within the next couple weeks.  I went way casual..lol. 
David Busby  ----->  There’s a badge for it so you don’t have to count next time lol
Cindy R  ----->  LOL....shows my true casual
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No ornaments yet but at least it has lights. 
Cindy R  ----->  So jealous! I hope we get moved, unpacked, and decorated before Christmas! 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Spots at bee labs 7 min till t5
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Our tree at home looks so sad and short now that we set up the in laws. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It’s festive and that’s all that matters. Size only matters to jazzy about ditto’s
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol that ditto... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And one without aggron to share
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wild drat behind momma mochas
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You can get it from Gay Street
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Just candy
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  But I don't want to power up gengar lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Don't let Blaine read that! The SC gengar is kinda worth it. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Cressila doesn't hit hard at all and I was getting two SB off easy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I bet with good dodge you can easily get 3 to 4 off
Cindy R  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh man!  I wish I could do that raid!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If it’s a shinx anyway😜
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Cindy R is saying she needs me to go do it to get close to good lol.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought that might be the case 😉
David Busby  ----->  Is bee lab shinx @Cindy R 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I think @Ian Fraser  appreciates the chart with aggron
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No. Mareep
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha Ian got the meta down
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I made two charts. One with that op aggron for us. And one for the other Mystic chat. Can't make them think aggron is good
Cindy R  ----->  @David Busby nope...stupid sheep 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Windy weather is the best bc of all the weather boosted dragons. Oops, I mean drowzees....
Ian Fraser  ----->  The game is trying to tell you it’s bedtime @Sam Kawell 
Cindy R  ----->  Spots at bee lab
Darren May  ----->  Anyone want to do the cresselia at Davis? Hatches around 1
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea 4 of us will be there @Darren May 
Ian Fraser  ----->  And by 4 I mean 3 lol
Darren May  ----->  Ok. Doing it at hatch?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If this mtg ever ends 🙄
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Not me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May we are inside
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yay! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  It is unclear if it is a bug or not, but it seems since the let's go event ended, research breakthroughs are no longer dropping sinoh stones. It might just be a little issue that will be fixed in a few hours, so if you can open the box today you might want to wait.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oops. Bye bye potions
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Sam Kawell Are you interested in any of these?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Only the eevees
Blaine, E  ----->  That gengar is awesome!
David Busby  ----->  Wait is that a lick gengar?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No hex
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Caught it by Dillard 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ok. I’ll save them for you. You 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Are there any other level 1 collectors in Auburn that you guys know of?
Cindy R  ----->  Meant to call it out earlier...we are almost there!
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Amanda open my gift pls! Just three more days of nagging you
Amanda  ----->  You’re in charge tomorrow 😁 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I wonder where I would be if it weren't for empty friend XP, but as it is, just passed 30M
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You must’ve really gone casual @Sam Kawell. Didn’t you hit 40 before me?
Sam Kawell  ----->  I really have... You have no idea
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Cindy looked at your exp and said....i thought he was a level 40.......i said yes that was 20mil lol.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, enjoy that baby boy. They don’t stay sweet forever 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh we are definitely enjoying him. He's learning to play the piano with great enthusiasm. https://v.groupme.com/39263023/2018-11-28T04:20:23Z/670a7ad0.640x360r.mp4
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, it looks like they haven't taken out Sinnoh stones from research breakthroughs, but they have just no longer made them a guarantee.... Yay.........
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oi. Hopefully they will introduce another way to get them. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell so cute! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  My XP or the baby?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Both haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You better watch out of the plebs like Blaine are gonna pass you in xp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If Amanda would just slow down on her raid exp then I could actually catch up
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Darren May @Matt Inger @Elizabeth Kidd Yost @Amanda think I’m going to pop an egg at 10:00 and do ultra friends with you guys. That work?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Go for it! 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Alright I’m going to go for it, @Matt Inger and @Darren May sorry if y’all were wanting me to wait but if I don’t do it now it’ll be weeks before I think about it again
Darren May  ----->  Go ahead. I’m just happy you’re alive
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Empty exp x 2 right there lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You gotta get the candies tho! 
Cindy R  ----->  @Keaton Rhea  Yall are leaving me behind... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not too far behind! 
Darren May  ----->  Chansey quest at duck samford children’s park. I don’t recall anyone posting it yet
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip stardust after that
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Show off lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Only 1.7 million how will you survive 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean compare that to the shiny Aaron lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's going to be tough being so low
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I also finished off another SB mu2
David Busby  ----->  I’m regretting maxing my 98 roserade. Didn’t do the hundo cause what if they give it some good move. Didn’t realize they were gonna make sinnoh stones impossible to find 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I decided I just didn't care and I'm gonna max it now. Even if it doesn't get out classed, odds are I'm never going to use it anyway
David Busby  ----->  I gave mine double poison just for shits n giggles
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t get a son oh stone today 😞 I hate Niantic 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mine had double poison and I wasted like 10 tm for Tha SB 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sinnoh stone. I hate auto carrot
Cindy R  ----->  And that's a wrap!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yay! Good job Cindy. I think I just hit bronze lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've pretty much given up the gym bully life. Maybe this summer I'll pick it back up since it will b my last
Cindy R  ----->  Daniel got mad...I gave huckleberry a pidgy and got this guy.  Hehehe...its not a perfect but will do. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Aw man. Does that mean I’m going to have to actually take bee lab myself 😂
Cindy R  ----->  LOL... @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Cindy R  ----->  I did have this gem...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E where is ur tiny swol rock man? 
Blaine, E  ----->  Exactly like Cindy's! Finished him today 😊
Blaine, E  ----->  Excuse me, her*
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pics or it didn't happen... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R was that a hatch or wild? 
Cindy R  ----->  Wild, in the backyard.  We didnt realize it until I started iv checking and was like...oh I hope you got that too. 🤣🤣🤣
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha nice! I got mine far away but didn't appraise it until much later
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea 
Cindy R  ----->  Hahaha....call him out Sam. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Helps to read it all. I just saw Tallassee and got the question.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  About time @Blaine, E! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wonder where Blaine caught hers.... 
Blaine, E  ----->  🙄 everyone knows I dont catch good things on my own...
Cindy R  ----->  Talk about a lucky trade! Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I forget it shows the ball used Sam. I've gone casual I guess
David Busby  ----->  @Blaine, E Next time he gives you grief just ask him how many rares he has 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes pls do
David Busby  ----->  What’s the answer now?
Blaine, E  ----->  Unless he used some more today he is a little below 400...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That trade was b4 lucky pokemon were released. It was a straight normal trade
David Busby  ----->  Oh wow nevermind then 
David Busby  ----->  He’s doing better than me but I’m still dumping for bag space 
Blaine, E  ----->  But thanks for the tip! I will take any advice on how to handle his sassy-ness! 😅
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't know what to dump them in.... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  BIDOOF
David Busby  ----->  Me either that’s why I’m trying to change bag space 
Blaine, E  ----->  All of you guys have plenty of bag space!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  For Blaine's bag space
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And storage 
David Busby  ----->  My Christmas present to you is bag space @Blaine, E 
David Busby  ----->  Gimme that login lol
Blaine, E  ----->  😅
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got it. I'll just post it on my bookface. If u can't find it u can log in lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If u can find it*
Blaine, E  ----->  Doubt. Since you don't know your own Facebook login info lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can auto login on chrome! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've not posted or done anything in like 10 yrs tho
Joseph Spalding  ----->  MantaStalker
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Found it. 🤘
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can auto recover password but it makes me verify my friends faces. Like is Pic a or Pic b of Charlie. And it's two ppl from highskool with a Pic of thier kids. Like I don't know who they are
Ian Fraser  ----->  you aren’t able to recover password through email? I mean I’ve had to every time I try and log into a new computer lol 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't know who Charlie is when it's two pics of baby girls!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope it does same BS every time. But I've put zero effort into bc I don't care about it
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  How about some non pokemon experts. Anyone keep up or remember semi older sports names....
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Does anyone collect?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So there maybe a little nerd mixed in
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If I had only known.......pokemon 
Blaine, E  ----->  Are you selling these @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ ??
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Packing for now but after we move I'll have time to research and sell some I hope. 
Blaine, E  ----->  Well I am all about that Denise Crosby if you do � I grew up with the next generation and met Brent Spiner this year - very nostalgic �
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I knew other trekies were out there lol.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I sure am glad we got another update. I enjoy sending a gift and scrolling back down to where I left off each time.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Isn't that how it used to be? Cause back then I only had like 10 friends....
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It was initially and then they fixed it. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I honestly cannot fathom how much of a mess their codebase must be. I know school teaches you code in an idealized fashion and real life is messy, but geez some of these bugs just make me wonder how.
Darren May  ----->  I appreciate their dependability though. Every “improvement” they make ends up being something that makes me play less
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Their commitment to subpar performance is exemplary. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  But I don't want that to happen. Even if the content sucks I love that the game gets me outside and lets me meet you people. Why you gotta screw up such an awesome thing, Niantic? Why u do dis?
Cindy R  ----->  I guess we are gonna need to start IV checking everything as we catch it in the yard!!  Another perfect from earlier.  Dang shame we are moving in a week..LOL
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Dang!
David Busby  ----->  Two hundo rhyhorns from one house??
David Busby  ----->  Have you sold already?
David Busby  ----->  I’m buying 
Cindy R  ----->  LOL, will be on the market in a month.  
Cindy R  ----->  I almost couldn't believe it!! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Every foul word I can think of...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Right there with ya @Sam Kawell 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Any way we can get our EX raids cancelled...? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  What I would give for that dust...
Sam Kawell  ----->  I just read an article about Russell Westbrook getting his 107th career triple double with a 15-15-15 game, and my initial reaction was, "Perfect IVs!".... what is happening to me....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Westbrook is a double double machine
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Triple*
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He is not Oscar Robertson level but I think he could break his record if he stays healthy long enough 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So I've been going through all my classes that I've taken at AU..... And I have 204 total credits. I think it's time to graduate 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well it’s 120 for undergrad so that doesn’t see too outrageous I think? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well I only needed 60 for PhD
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just a large number to see. I don't know what I expected. I never check it
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Dang. You sure are a glutton for punishment @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean it's not really that bad.... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  That’s like one extra semester. Sooo could be worse. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I did take take what a large number of PhD students considered to be the hardest engineering class at AU twice. For fun. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not really in ECE. 6 hrs is like a full work load bc of research (and pokemon) 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was dumb and took 9 hrs one sem and it was horrible 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yeah, nope. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  This is grad skewl work load, not under grad. 6 to 7 hrs is prob on par with 15 under grad. U add in research, conferences, journal papers it gets dense
Ian Fraser  ----->  And that's why I won't be doing grad school unless someone else wants to pay for it.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It depends on what u go into grad school for. U can get tuition waivers + monthly stiepen in most engineering. But if u look at like pharm... Then ur going into debt
Ian Fraser  ----->  Only reason I would / would have two would be to go into data science I think. My impression is that grad degrees are pretty highly valued in that field.
Blaine, E  ----->  I can confirm with the debt statement above
Sam Kawell  ----->  Don't know if it's been shared anywhere, but from a post on TSR it looks like it'll be random Kanto birds and Jhoto Beasts from research breakthroughs in December. Interesting.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Shiny rai? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pls
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was thinking about how salty I'll be when I get 4 Sui... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I do have a hundo to power up
Sam Kawell  ----->  Personally, I like the random stuff. I wish that they had done a random previously available legendary from each research breakthrough since the beginning
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Won’t be ray though @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Raikou 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I must be a high cp Pokemon in a gym because my motivation just dropped real fast.
Sam Kawell  ----->  But@Ian Fraser  remember that research breakthroughs also give you a chance at sinnoh stones. Doesn't that make you super duper excited!
Ian Fraser  ----->  I’m hoping Niantic realizes what a terrible decision they’ve made in the met four days
Ian Fraser  ----->  *next
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Amanda would you be free to get to besties sometime tonight?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Some people did layman's research on the drop rate of sinnoh stones from research breakthroughs and found out that the rate is somewhere around 25% (out of around 350 breakthroughs).... Yay
Sam Kawell  ----->  If that is true, around 1/3 people won't get a sinnoh stone every month
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Since I claimed my research breakthrough the morning they released sinnoh stones, I only got the one guaranteed one ☹️ 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm sorry Elizabeth! I hope ur luck improves 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  U can have Jr's luck 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I didn't get one today. So long hopes and dreams. I didn't want to make a rhypiorion army no way lol.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Now they're just mocking us
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I hate Niantic 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Top Men. 
Amanda  ----->  @Sam Kawell Whenever is good for you.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'll be doing it at 9
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Amanda 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Michelle U you're in Gatlinburg?!?! I'm so jealous!
Michelle U  ----->  Haha Yes! Based on recs from @Blaine, E and Ashley, thought we'd check  it out😃 pretty good spawns here too 😉
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Michelle U When are you going to open that gift I sent you like 3 weeks ago? 😭
Michelle U  ----->  I decided it's more fun to send then open!! 😆 lol jk was waiting since we're going to hit best! Lmk when is a good time for you
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I can do now
Joseph Spalding  ----->  😁
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Unless you had other plans, that is. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Ian Fraser  ----->  ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Joe asking to do egg now last night
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Looks like a new gym bully in town.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Instank and valor better watch out 
Blaine, E  ----->  #neveragain. 1 and done. Too much anxiety towards the end 😅
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  When I did that, my 21st gym was the middle one at the museum. Mike came out while I was taking it to give me a hard time. I was like please just let me get my screen shot and I’ll leave it gray for you!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  F for frandz 
😢

Stiffed again on the besties. Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. The third time it's enemy action. 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  Check out @PokemonGoApp’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/PokemonGoApp/status/1068520102591516674?s=09
Sam Kawell  ----->  Umm guys
Ian Fraser  ----->  😱😱😱
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Cost to pvp?  A sinnoh stone...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Plus 1M stardust per battle
Darren May  ----->  Nah you will get one free battle pass per day and have to pay for more, probably 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  But I do hope they don’t release it this weekend. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That would be stupid
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Win the battle and u get super rare items like nanab, red balls, and gen2 evo items
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  In another non Pokemon related post....?"$#@!##%%....jsut got real lol. @Cindy R 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Exciting!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So why does it feel more like nervous anxiety lol.
Cindy R  ----->  Hey I need those tennis shoes! LOL
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E lets see it
Blaine, E  ----->  NOT named by me 😅
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well beat this 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  Course if they don’t overhaul the battle system it’ll just be tap tap revolution..
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just a heads up to ppl who have outside cats in the auburn area. Carroll just found a sick cat in our front yard and had to call animal control. He thinks the cat has rabies and I don't think it's the first one he's picked up. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I really hope the kitty is ok. :/
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  🙁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We know someone that works at AU vet clinic and she is going to see if they bring the cat to them. Hopefully can give us some more info
Blaine, E  ----->  Yeah I'm glad you said something, we have a ton of strays by my house and I keep wanting to bring them all inside
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Save them! Bring them all inside
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Blaine chilling at her house
Blaine, E  ----->  Chris would kill me if I took one more cat in but he's not here for now soooo 🤔
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Do it! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The cat is with Natalie now at AU vet. They are testing for rabies :(
Blaine, E  ----->  😿
Keaton Rhea  ----->  https://v.groupme.com/39263023/2018-11-30T18:54:12Z/4b860f0f.640x360r.mp4
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The poor cat :(
Sam Kawell  ----->  So a couple people in the media have said they have been able to test PvP and one said they will release an article next week.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Maybe the reason for the shitshow of random bugs is because they’ve had their entire dev team working on pvp and a battle rework these last 6+ months...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is a little more optimistic than I think I can be.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And I'm pretty optimistic 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Who has twitter? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also friends list jumping fixed in the latest APK!!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't twat
Sam Kawell  ----->  I have zero shame and totally retweeted that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E starting off strong 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  What did she get?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Did research change?
Blaine, E  ----->  Shiny dratini 😁 didn't have one yet!
Sam Kawell  ----->  In support of Niantic, I think CP is useful if not only for the tiers. That way, you can have an azumarill fight a Rayquaza and it'll be decently matched.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Now we have yet to see if super defensive pokes (registeel for example) will be OP bc CP considers atk more important
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Safe to evo? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  TSR says yes
Ian Fraser  ----->  I would test on a starter if you’re willing to toss the candy 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm low on candy! And I've got two hundo to evo 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's safe 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks Elizabeth! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You’re welcome I guess 🤨
David Busby  ----->  Wtf
David Busby  ----->  Where my hundo larvitar trades at. I have a perfect bad 12/12/12 lucky larvitar but that’s not gonna cut it 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t get a Hundo out of it.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm sorry :(
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’s ok. You did me a big favor. I was glad you got something good out of it. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I didn't give u a single good thing tho :(. I still owe you
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think I got a 12/12/12 lucky drat.... To lazy to even check. Might axe
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or 13 what ever is worst
Ian Fraser  ----->  12 is worst. I usually give better than I get in trades...still chasing that first perfect lucky. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have two perfect luckiest and both times I felt bad bc I got a perfect and the other person didn’t. 
David Busby  ----->  Cough cough rayquaza and ogre
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You got a lucky Pikachu and snorlax! 
David Busby  ----->  That damn pikachu is still taking up a bag space lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I bet you get salty every time you see it...transfer it!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  We could always trade drats again @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I had the same luck with Matt Morgan that I had with you @Joseph Spalding !
Ian Fraser  ----->  Isn’t one of those luckies from me @Elizabeth Kidd Yost ? 😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes!  
Ian Fraser  ----->  It’s okay, I’m just eternally jealous of your perfect penguin.  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He’s so cute!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If any one was casual like me and did the 10 raids meltan quest on mostly free passes, then u might want to hit up the lileep nest next to IM fields gym
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E @Ian Fraser 
Darren May  ----->  Some people haven’t gotten to the 10 raids part yet. #casual4life
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I hit it hard the past few days to get it done haha
Sam Kawell  ----->  I love how no one is calling out shinies until Sunday night in the big group ...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  They just can’t help themselves. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I get it. It's some of thier first shiny pokemon. They just want the same attention as when ppl post them outside of events
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But that said, it's annoying and I won't be keeping up with big grewp
Sam Kawell  ----->  Okay, that girl with the 43 shinies amongst her family definitely is not in that first group
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No she’s not. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes im not a fan of her
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But there r lvl 20a posting too
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nor is West..
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Or Taylor
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Surprisingly, I am in neither group! Winning. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  FYI looks like the shiny rate is probably increased to normal CD rates during the 3 hour event as opposed to the “boosted but not 1/25” we have right now 
David Busby  ----->  Raid ttars have smackdown too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So I'm doing great with 2.5 hrs played and no shiny! I'm gonna need niantec to help me out
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I got two shiny last night in about 3 hours played. A shiny chickorita and eevee. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  So my luck is not much better than yours @Keaton Rhea 😂😂😂😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean shiny eevee is still cool
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Go ahead and say that again. With conviction that you believe it this time. 😂
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Convince me. 🤣
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m not even checking chikorita but I like shiny eevee. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Shiny Eevee is great!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Shiny eevee is ok. Shiny jolteon tho is where it's at
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I have the ultimate shiny eeveeloution already. I can’t best this. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And umbreon 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like jolteon bc its my fav. It's really not that great of a shiny. But umbreon is beautiful 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  U guys jelly? 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Green jelly
Darren May  ----->  Stand back everyone 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have this one. 
David Busby  ----->  Why are you holding onto those lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Why do you still have that lucky Pikachu?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So I took fake Starbucks earlier and the black suns appear to have filled it up. This was dropped about the same time. So I think we know who these accounts belong to...
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Like locust, they consume. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm calling B.S. on huckleberry all go plused lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Now that’s some b.s. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ve got about 6 hours of play between yesterday and today and now have three shinies. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm at 5.5 hrs... Only shiny was from jr
Ian Fraser  ----->  That’s surprising. I was only at two last night but I’m at 9 since the event inside an event started. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I cri eriteim for you @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I cri like a baby all the time
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Welp maybe jr will get more later. 
Cindy R  ----->  We played about 5 hours today and I end up with 21.  
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Huckleberrys final was 16....15 were go plused. Only thing missing was a shiny carp to slap me in the face lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can't complain since Daniel doesn't have a karp. But still waiting for my first of the event with bad home spawns
Sam Kawell  ----->  I was able to get 4 in an hour and a half!
Sam Kawell  ----->  And I attempted a Cresselia raid with a 39, 36, 26, and 10 and beat it with 0 seconds on the clock
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wow nice! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess the lvl 10 is what put u over
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Was it more stressful than the trio VS DB/DC latios with Darren at Wilmore? 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Sloot go plussed a single shiny
Sam Kawell  ----->  It was. I knew that you guys had counters. The level 26 had a Tauros in his top 6 and he let me pick them...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sounds like the regice with Jin and Lauren. She let me pick her team the 3rd try with 20 mins left to start lobby. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Jin told me about that. We were going to do one with her and I had to go get the iPad from my car and do it on Kaitlin’s account to make sure we beat it on the first try. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nothing against her. She is very nice. But she doesn't know meta. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That was pre jr days and me and Jin were throwing a damn good squad of lvl 40 Champs. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think I was her first best friend this week. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Nah. She and I have been besties for a while. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Elizabeth always better frand than me! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She prob just meant not best with anyone there
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Home made meatballs anyone? 
Blaine, E  ----->  🙋‍♀️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Greek seasoning. Put them in pitas with maters and lettuce and a yogurt sauce I made
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I ate it so fast I didn't take a Pic haha
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They are good by themselves 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Gonna need those ubered to Tallassee asap lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll send via messenger dog. She I'd strong and robust 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh no... She ate the cargo! 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  No tip
Blaine, E  ----->  I change my mind, I would like this Keaton. Everyday please and thank you!
Darren May  ----->  In semi related pokenews, Matt baker told me that I look like liev Schreiber today. I’ll take it
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Should I go ahead and evolve her or wait and see what I get tomorrow?
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean if you have the candies I’d say why not 
David Busby  ----->  @Darren May He told leslie she looks like phyliss from the office. You got off easy lol
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Look what I found 
Ian Fraser  ----->  HE LIVES
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby I think that may be a better comparison than me and liev
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I can see it 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So what's the census on making SD ttars? Is everyone trying to make several or....?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ve done two so far. Holding out on one more for that elusive 💯 I’ve yet to catch. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  And your thoughts on DN with DM?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hopefully all our previous thoughts about moves will be completely changed if they give us a battle rework along with PvP
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So should I evolve a good drat just to have one with dm?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Might as well. I'm assuming you're not starving for drat candies
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Not exactly
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I think I'm at 5 smack down ttars and 2 Drago dnites. And make 1 more of each tomorrow and maybe make 2 more medagross. I'm with @Elizabeth Kidd Yost my candies not exactly safe, maybe 400 left of each and I pinaped everything lol.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh I have close to a thousand Dragonite candies. Not so good on ttars and beldum
Cindy R  ----->  I have 6 SD Ttr, as normal need more stardust to top out the 3 I made tonight. 

I have 5 DM nites. But again need stardust to top out the 3 from today. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  This morning she said we need to trade some......5 minutes later.....oh it says I don't have enough dust to trade......100.....really lol.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You need to keep a buffer 
Cindy R  ----->  😁😝 I just can't keep it...I tried to be like @Keaton Rhea , but there is always something that needs it..LOL 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I just pretend I have no dust when I get to about 250k. It’s hard but I like to have some in case I get something really good. 
Cindy R  ----->  I wish I had your will power...there is always something I waste it on! This week I realized I had 2 98iv champs and a 98 if nite I had forgotten about..lol https://v.groupme.com/39263023/2018-12-02T05:20:07Z/4cd0dfeb.640x360r.mp4
David Busby  ----->  So here’s how I do my dust. I have a 500k buffer unless I get something really good that’s meta. I’m holding on to that 500k for the day I need to max several counters to short man a raid if that’s ever needed 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I do the same as David but my buffer is usually about 1M. I'm more limited by rare candy anyways 
Darren May  ----->  Haha, I have no buffer. I’m proud of myself that I recently got over 500k bitcim eyeing several vanity power ups.
Darren May  ----->  It must run in the family because my family is here for the weekend and my brother has no stardust to trade. Although he just powers up things indiscriminately and doesn’t understand how it works. I had to give him strict instructions so we can trade at Xmas 
Darren May  ----->  *but i’m* autocarrot 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You should have had him out catching yesterday so he could get dust!
Darren May  ----->  Oh he was catching yesterday. Apparently he randomly power ups stuff after he catches it. Also must have transferred a lot of stuff too because he had no larvitars to trade. Took me a minute to figure out why I couldn’t trade him any mutus 
Darren May  ----->  I had to give him the snookems talk. But to Snookems credit he now has more dust than me and was offended when I told him he could power up his lucky dragonite 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Ok. I only have enough candies to evolve AND power up one of these guys. Which one should I do? I also have another 96 that I’ve been slowly powering up as I get candies. 
Darren May  ----->  How many with meteor mash do you already have?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Evo both and power them up later
Keaton Rhea  ----->  U will prob hatch enough beldum later anyways 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Better to get exclusive move now
Darren May  ----->  I agree. Also don’t know how pvp will work so that lower cp one could be valuable 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would get a few DM dnite too in case PvP makes it more viable. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But prob don't need 6. PvP will most likely not favor monotype teams.... I hope
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The real question is how many more SD ttar I need. 
Blaine, E  ----->  4 more
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can only evo 3 more right now :(
Ian Fraser  ----->  *3 you can have this trash 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, when trying to plan for PvP from some released pictures, it's almost certain you'll only be fighting with teams of 3, not 6
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was thinking of evolving both. They just aren’t much use if they aren’t powered up. Hopefully I will be able to catch some more today. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Darren May This many. But the shinies are no good. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost true they won't be of any use until u power them up, but we have no idea what the next raid boss will be. I don't see them being a top counter anytime soon unless we get a good fairy raid boss 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell that makes sense. Almost all competition now in main series is teams of 4 double battles or teams of 3 singles (pick 3 show 6)
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well this is from the Pokemon go Twitter
Ian Fraser  ----->  Looks like they’ll revamp the party screen too? If they drop PvP while I’m gone for the break I’m gonna be sad.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Catch a dragon for drat quest. Might already b on site
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Next to walker 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Is that the stop right next to the Cary gym? @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Between walker and Cary. Not the Cary hall marker
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Power up 10 times for 3 silver pinap as well not too far away
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ross
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I could certainly find something to power up 😉
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Broun hall same quest
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My only shiny from the event :/
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's not max.... 
Blaine, E  ----->  We can trade shinies, don't axe it yet!
Cindy R  ----->  Wow that stinks! @Keaton Rhea  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I only played about 8 hrs total. Jr got a drat anc chikorita. Same amount of play time.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not much point is saving a bad squirttle tho.... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I only caught them when I was on a star piece. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I checked but didn't catch anything that was not the big 3
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E i will have some spare SD ttar if u want to trade any spares
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I know you wanted some
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only two good things from this weekend
Blaine, E  ----->  YES @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got you. Don't worry
Blaine, E  ----->  Were you wanting to trade SD ttars, or trade for something else?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Basically give them away lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  I somehow got five total over around 3 hours of play. I added a Dratini to my Eevee, Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and cindequil from yesterday.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  ~10 hours of play and 4 shiny. I cri eriteim 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got one on main!............ Played about 7.5 or 8 hrs? 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Der sloot only got one in that 10 hours of play
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  For Der sloot
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea you got 2 shiny karps in the past two months so I don't feel sorry for you
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm actually giving those away. I almost xfered them b4 event... You want? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If not they prob getting axe soon
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I spent my luck in wrong spot 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All I wanted was a mareep
Sam Kawell  ----->  Nope. I'm going to catch my own eventually dadgum it
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t get a mareep either. First one I clicked on for Kaitlin yesterday was shiny.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I played like 3 hrs first time around. Zero. Checked all this time. Zero. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Me too. I have one that I got from Lauren but I still wanted to catch my own 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Hannah just got a shiny Squirtle. Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She can have all of my squirtle.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  I have an extra now if you want it @Keaton Rhea 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Or @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Purple sheep that is 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wanted to catch it. And complain 
Ian Fraser  ----->  lord knows I’m not going to do anything with it 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  James got a single shiny too. A mareep. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  James was prob a better poke trainer than me this weekend 
Matt Inger  ----->  Looks like I got 7 shiny on the weekend.  Only one I’m missing is Bulbasaur.  Got lucky this morning with a 98 beldum. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If I ever catch a bulba it's urs @Matt Inger! I had to get my first via trade
Darren May  ----->  Put up some prayers to the pokegods. I’m going out one last time in search for shiny eevees and thicc larvitars
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I pray to the poke gods. Darren will catch 27 shiny nodiking. Or just a few other shiny
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nidoking. Dang I can't type 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or M nidoran I guess now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It would make me verrrry happy to give Darren a shiny Nido M
Darren May  ----->  Update: museum isn’t even lured up. Amateurs 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
David Busby  ----->  Soooo I can remove Taylor from mystic right?
David Busby  ----->  Only just now got off and read up
Sam Kawell  ----->  This has been a very interesting read tonight.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I just finished too
David Busby  ----->  Man I wanted to go fucking Pokémon instead of dealing with his childish bullshit 
Ian Fraser  ----->  ^ and that’s why he hasn’t said anything in Mystic 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  I vote no. If he gets the idea that we’re truly not tolerating his crap I think it’ll help. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess I'm wrong but I think he can change. He does deserve punishment 
David Busby  ----->  He’s what 30 with no friends outside Pokémon? I don’t think he’s gonna change. He’s just run everyone off
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok :( just makes me sad that he is that way 
David Busby  ----->  Keaton your just too nice bro
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess so
Matt Inger  ----->  He’s crossed the line too many times. I’d give him the axe.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It just hits too close to home. I'm similar with no frands outside of pokemon. But I treat my frands with respect. 
Blaine, E  ----->  1. You have friends out of pokemon, and if you don't who cares: pokemon friends can be real friends 
2. You are not a jerk to them - that is a big difference 
David Busby  ----->  What she said. It’s different.
Darren May  ----->  Finished with 7 shinies. 3 of which were mareeps
Cindy R  ----->  Sad thing is I talk to yall more than I do some of my non poke friends...never a reason to be rude!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It’d be one thing if he was rude like that to one of us that he knows well and plays with regularly, but he completely lashed out at random casual that most likely had never even met him or raided with him. And that is unacceptable. 
Darren May  ----->  He made me feel bad for Parker. That’s unforgivable!
David Busby  ----->  Best part, Parker was the bigger man about it by far. Nothing negative back 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I always thought Taylor's level 40 elitism was semi-joking, but today kind of proved that wrong. As far as kicking him out of mystic, I think he should be removed for at least a little while to show that all the teams are in solidarity against comments like that, but I don't think it should be permanent if he is willing to genuinely apologize and try to at least hide his disgust of casuals (among which I count myself...)
Sam Kawell  ----->  Anyway, Sam out
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I get this instead of the other good shiny... 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I cri eriteim 
Darren May  ----->  Anyone want to do davis around noon?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can do it with main but jr is out of passes and I think i used up big coins for bg space
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hunter posted in big group he could do it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  Ugh 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol
David Busby  ----->  I could do it in like 15 if you want 
Darren May  ----->  Can the 3 of us do it?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Keaton Rhea You could do it on my account if you’re not going to use jr. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's possible to trio but very hard
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Let's check jr
David Busby  ----->  I’d like to try the trio
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He has coins so we can use him or Elizabeth as back up
David Busby  ----->  I could always throw df3 on jrs phone too
Darren May  ----->  12:15 then?
David Busby  ----->  Works for me 
David Busby  ----->  I’m here but I’m waiting for facilities to leave lol. Might have to go park in Zoes employee parking 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Feel free to toss mine on jrs phone if need 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’d join, but were over at spicers for lessons right now. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby they are doing something with the recycling bins
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Let me know when it’s safe for me to be on my account. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ur safe. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Close haha
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Noice!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My last mewtwo died right b4 it too 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Spots bee lab
David Busby  ----->  Apparently new update in iOS fixes the jumping around glitch when sending gifts
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I just sent gifts. It was still jumping around. When does this update come out?
David Busby  ----->  You can force it in App Store I just did. Reporting back shortly
David Busby  ----->  Seems to be working
David Busby  ----->  @Ian Fraser You were not lying about an announcement about an announcement
David Busby  ----->  Hype about the nidorino v gengar pic tho
Ian Fraser  ----->  I never lie
David Busby  ----->  I seriously thought you were making a joke though when you said it
David Busby  ----->  I laughed
David Busby  ----->  Now I cri
Sam Kawell  ----->  I know it's retro, but that's such an interesting matchup. Nidorino would get pwned
David Busby  ----->  Would he in gen 1 mechanics? They’ve changed so much since then
Sam Kawell  ----->  No clue. I knew nothing about the battle system back then except victreebel was super cool and I couldn't wait until Blastoise learned body slam
Sam Kawell  ----->  I barely knew type advantages except the obvious ones
David Busby  ----->  Wait I’m talking about red and blue
Sam Kawell  ----->  Me too. I started on blue
David Busby  ----->  Oh tm I see it on bulbapedia now 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Also, I just realized I can bring my 98% shadow ball Mewtwo up to 2499 cp
David Busby  ----->  @Sam Kawell I will give you 7 days after pvp commences. If that isn’t a top tier pvp candidate by then I’ll do something
David Busby  ----->  Unless it’s level 40
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  They’re not 98s but they do have shadowball 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So my friends list is still jumping just in a different way. Now, when I’m scrolling it just randomly changes order. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  https://pokemongolive.com/post/trainerbattles
Sam Kawell  ----->  Ace trainer medal!!!!!!!!!!
Darren May  ----->  Dang, beat me to it @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  After they figure out all the inevitable bugs, it actually looks really cool
Ian Fraser  ----->  I'm not pleased it'll be timing based, purely because we see how well that worked with the dodge bug
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well it doesn't look like dodging will be a part of it, and I guess it'll be like any online game: you can always blame your loss on the lag
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like that u can battle from a distance, not just in person 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Teams of 3 will make it where u will always have a gap in typ coverage offensively and defensively. That is what makes the battle towers in main series so dang hard
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That and the AI straight up cheats once u get to a certain point. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I wonder how they will handle multi accounting with this. Poor jr might end up with a 0/266493010173 battle record
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah that is definitely me.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Come on..... 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That’s awesome @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :(
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It may be boring, but an extra bullet point on the ol resume never hurts
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I thought u were talking about the shiny. The email is some conf in Japan. Yeah I'm not attending that one 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Ahh. Just noticed the -Japan after ASME. That makes sense, but it could be a fun trip. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I thought the name was funny. They have my full name from some other conference, but yet they don't know Im a student 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, the more I read about it, the more excited I get. If it performs as they advertise, it'll be amazing.
Amanda  ----->  I feel like we’re gonna start keeping secrets from each other, and I’m going to have to study....
Amanda  ----->  But we can play with Sam again other than sending gifts.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  PvP always has a meta. That meta will b on interwebs. There will prob be an ideal team with a few variations and one that counters it. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Look at the vgc teams from handheld. U will see the same 15 pokemon over and over. Just slight variations here and there. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Xerneas, kartana, primal groudon, amoongus
Darren May  ----->  I’m rolling with nidoking, ampharos and Blastoise. Try and stop me
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Is there a lower smackdown breakpoint I should aim for if I don’t have the dust currently to power up multiple ones to 40?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can check on it after lunch but yes. It was 35.5 for birds pre CP rework
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Was there a specific poke u were looking to counter with SD ttar? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  35.5 covers molt, art, and zap
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hooh final is 38.5, but the other is only 32
Darren May  ----->  No, I was making a powerup list to see how much stardust I need and quickly realized I have nowhere near enough for all my vanity power ups
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Fun fact. U could easily duo ho oh in partly cloudy with just lvl 32 ttar
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean anything invested in ttar will b realitvley safe. Rock is one of the best offensive types in the game as far as neutral/SE coverage 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Picked this up somewhere today!  
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea you just need to stop it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol it's not even the ones I want! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  When u know kento came to visit. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Tell him to just say hi brow
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't want hi. I want to call in the nuke
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh in that case just tell Valor he said the gym was his 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No I call in Jin. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The nuke
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Let kentoo sing you the song of his people!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Does he shave him out or take the whole thing?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I felt @Amanda needed a trick but shot since we hadn't seen her in a while.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Two is better than one
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost he takes the whole thing down but I can ask for you to stay if you want 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well I didn't see this coming today. Noice
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No that’s fine @Keaton Rhea i was just curious
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That was fast
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He was doing it when u responded haha
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I figured. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell gonna need to see that as a lvl 40 metapod
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May wild chansey just past the Davis hall marker stop
Keaton Rhea  ----->  North of the stop in the parking lot
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So happy I tried so hard to finish those quests..... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So do you or he care if I take it back. Or do you want to do it when you come home @Keaton Rhea ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Do what ever u want. I'm sure Jin just dropped random stuff
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea too late. It's already a Butterfree
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Not
Really
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thats trash in my book lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll tell him ur the gym bully! 
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea Thanks. I was in a meeting across campus of course
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea What time are you doing waterfall?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Getting food now and grabbing Ian's phone then we will do it. Want to b2b with plainsman for jr
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Plainsman hatches at 1
Darren May  ----->  I can do waterfall. Plainsman May be a stretch 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We have enough for both so you don't have to do plainsman if you don't want. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We should head to WF soon @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  Omw 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We will need to get Ian's phone first from haley
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't know if you want to wait a sec for that
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Do you guys think I Can solo pinsir?
Sam Kawell  ----->  You should be able to. He's easier than alolan Raichu
Sam Kawell  ----->  Just use fire types
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yeah I looked it up. It’s sunny too
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Did you guys do plainsman already @Keaton Rhea ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We just finished. Sorry
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No problem 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Well, ho-ohs suck against pinsir in case you wanted to know. I got it though. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  In other news
Darren May  ----->  I think you’ve actually been more hardcore since turning 40 than before
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t know about that, but I do have 42 best friends. 
Darren May  ----->  That will do it too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nahh Elizabeth is just going at it more hardcore
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wtf... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You should go 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Can u take me? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm gonna need some monies to make this ex raid
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I need some input. Most meta relevant eeveeloution including glaceon and leafeon?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm to casual to know that lol.....buy good morning 
Sam Kawell  ----->  It's either Glaceon or Flareon
Sam Kawell  ----->  Leafeon is a very good grass attacker, but grass isn't very meta
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  And here I was leaning toward Espeon because I used to use it vs machamp all the time 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well it's very good for that, but not much more
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Let me ask another way: which eeveeloution ranks highest in its type category for DPS?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I know glaceon and leafeon may not be concrete yet so could be hard. I’ve got a perfect eevee I’m walking now and want to make sure I don’t evolve it to the wrong thing
Sam Kawell  ----->  Well aside from those two, Espeon and Flareon
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Cool. Will probably go Espeon if the other two don’t get released soon. Just waiting on the mechanics to be announced cause I think it’d be cool to have a perfect glaceon/leafeon
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Thanks for the input as always 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What Sam said is correct for DPS. But it seems that TDO might be more important for PvP. Especially in the lower tiers. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I know it's really far out, but I can see slyveon being best fairy in the game. Glaceon could be a good cheap ice atk if they don't cost sinnoh stone (or some other rare item). 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sinnoh stone gated glaceon... 😡😡😡
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I triggered Ian 
Darren May  ----->  I could live with needing an item to evolve if you were guaranteed to get the eeveelution you wanted
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay that's fair. So long as it's not a ridiculously rare drop in pvp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Same. I still want the gen1 eevee to have a garenteed evo too
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Would glaceon be better than Weavile?
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  I know it’s all theoretical but....you’re usually pretty close with your projections 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've not looked at the exact stats/moves but I would guess yes. Weavile is glass cannon. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mamoswine is the ice type to worry about
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Then next gen we get kyruem and then all of them are trash we have now 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Unless they do the hooh thing and doing give it a stab QM
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May pharmacy school marker is hatch an egg for exe encounter if ur still looking for them
Sam Kawell  ----->  Even from a TDO standpoint, Glaceon and Flareon are top5 of their respective types
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Darren May want to do willmore 
Darren May  ----->  I can. What time?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Asap? The four of us are here. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  We can be flexible tho
Darren May  ----->  Ok omw 
Ian Fraser  ----->  We inside for obvious reasons
Blaine, E  ----->  @Joseph Spalding 😑
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Blaine, E I have a disease. Other than that, I plead the fifth. 🤣
Keaton Rhea  ----->  U had over 100k last night! I have proof! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I shall neither confirm nor deny that statement 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Back to back hatches..... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay now I'm jelly
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May wild egg at whittle dorm
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea have your never evolved a turtwig?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol no... None of the new starters
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was waiting for a good one....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And idk if I want to wait until community day like a yr away now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What a nice outfit! 
Blaine, E  ----->  ...
Blaine, E  ----->  I love it! 😭😭 thank you @Keaton Rhea !
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You are welcome! :) 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not sure how it got there tho
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nope should have just denied it, now you blew it 😂
David Busby  ----->  Ok so leslie dropped a haunter in Felton while it was under attack...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  🙄
Joseph Spalding  ----->  are you really surprised?...
David Busby  ----->  I called her out on it and she said idk I panicked and just needed to drop something
David Busby  ----->  So I responded with but if your dropping a haunter did you really
Joseph Spalding  ----->  pokemaster
David Busby  ----->  Expert defender of gyms
David Busby  ----->  Especially the library
David Busby  ----->  With like double my hours defended 😡
Joseph Spalding  ----->  My condolences. I'm sorry for your loss. lol
David Busby  ----->  New sprites in game. Is that the ice type snowman thing up top? I recognize the others I think
David Busby  ----->  Tangrowth nevermind I is not well versed in this gen lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes pure grass 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Could be good PvP if it gets good moves. I don't remember what it got
David Busby  ----->  It didn’t get best possible moveset I don’t think 
David Busby  ----->  Doesn’t the bottom right one have an unevolved form? Not sure if that’s toxicroak or crogunk 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is crogunk
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Toxicroak is 2nd stage 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Bonsly bottom left is baby sudowoodo
Blaine, E  ----->  Considering I had less than 100 coins, no one would believe I bought the outfit myself @Ian Fraser !  
I see the conversation moved on but I'm delayed 😅
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I believe you! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  U had 20....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just don't look at the pokemon I named.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby looks like yamna evo got good bug move set at least! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Toxicroak is not really anything to write home about. Poison fighting. He has gimmicks with his ability in main game on lower tiers. He does not like taking a future site to face. 
Blaine, E  ----->  That will be a treat for me after work I guess Keaton lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Scavenger hunt! 
Darren May  ----->  Yeet!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Apk update is out. Ham was right @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yay! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Right about what?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also RIP

Ian Fraser  ----->  Ham guessed they would roll out the clientside pvp update this weekend @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So from the APK mine, Dronpes has found pretty convincing evidence there will be status effects in PvP
David Busby  ----->  This is curious as well
Sam Kawell  ----->  And it looks like there will be a warning if your next power up will bump your poke out of a league. So you probably won't be able to downgrade your pokes
Sam Kawell  ----->  Don't know if it's been shared anywhere, but the new loading screen is pretty awesome.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Did you get from the APK or the play store? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Apkmirror
Sam Kawell  ----->  I couldn't wait
Darren May  ----->  Good for pvp?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Probably! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Light lunch.... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Dang, that looks good! That someplace in Auburn?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Columbus 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Called old Chicago 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pizza and taproom. Pretty new. Only been open a few months
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I was just by there at hobby lobby
Joseph Spalding  ----->  that place is pretty good
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes very good! 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Dangit. Oh well. 
Blaine, E  ----->  I like that Carroll patiently waits for you to take the picture lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  Some things are important! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes very patient
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She had to get me sauced up b4 shopping 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  people dont think compromise be like it do, but it is
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Very true
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So is there any way to reach the student center by car?
Ian Fraser  ----->  You can drive up the Heisman loop around the stadium?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes, but u will have to get out of ur car for a sec to go get it. It looks like it's the stop between Haley and student center. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I doubt anyone is there so u could just drive up thru there. There is nothing stopping u but you will have to back up
Darren May  ----->  There is a b-ball game tonight though. There was a guard at plainsman so they may have a guard at the parking deck too
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No guard at the heisman loop but there was at the arena. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Enjoy your trip @Blaine, E ! Try to stay focused. I know that it is an awful drive. 
Blaine, E  ----->  Thanks! @Keaton Rhea Ashley took first driving shift and Kruti is navigating so I can minimally focus for now 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Good thing kruti is navigating otherwise u would end up in NY! 
Blaine, E  ----->  ...that is not an inaccurate statement 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You should have to put that you qualify as 'navigation challenged' on ur resume 
Blaine, E  ----->  🙄 thanks friend
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You are welcome! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’s a good thing for gps because I fall asleep in the car. Just can’t stay awake even after coffee. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can't sleep at all on the car or the plane. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All long distance flights im up and wired. 
Blaine, E  ----->  Well our navigator let us take a wrong turn @Keaton Rhea 😂 I partly blame all the gift posts 😝 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh no I hope it doesn't add to much to ur trip
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But it was prob bc of Ian's follow up post. Clearly not mine
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And how do u make a wrong turn? There is like only one exit once u get close to mobile.... 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  2 wrongs don’t make a right, but 4 lefts sure do. 
Blaine, E  ----->  Well remember I dont have to focus right now so I'm not 100% sure how it happened, but it did lol 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Must of been ur fault... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m going to be so clueless for pvp. Y’all help me!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Everyone will be clueless for the first week or so while smarter people figure out the math behind it lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I know you, Amanda and Blaine all think I am going to keep secrets and screw you guys over... But I'm not. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't think dominating PvP will really mean that much other than bragging rights
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Some of you seem to be pretty on top of it already. I’ve never played any of the other games so I feel completely behind. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If they do add status moves, there will be tons of ways to win a 3v3 battle. I'm sure you will be able to just use the things you like! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My first battle I will prob use what I like! KarKar, Emilynn, and precious. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  There weren't status moves in the APK so don't think those will be a thing at launch
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip. That is the only way I can see there being any real strategy 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well we'll have to see how two charge moves shake things up plus the shield/charge move mini game 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah I will have to see that. But it's going to be obvious what the ideal 2nd move should be since the move pools are so shallow. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pretty much every mon has one bad QM and one bad CM. A few exceptions. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The shield thing will have an obvious time to use it. It's prob just having to decide if u switch or if u shield in a bad match up
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m confused just reading this. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol I can explain it to you in person if needed once it's released and we have all info
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm sure both of u that are confused will pick it up real quick
Ian Fraser  ----->  You'll get it super quickly. Literally only know this stuff because of going through the APK mining.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  PvP won't be fun if ur opponent has no idea what's going on
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Maybe I'll make some ttar only teams... 
David Busby  ----->  @Ian Fraser They actually did find some stuff indicative of status effects in the latest data mine 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I see stuff about stat bonuses/debuffs but nothing like lseep/confusion/etc. Am I looking at the right thing?
Ian Fraser  ----->  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/a454tt/the_silph_roads_apk_teardown_of_v01311_a_highly/
David Busby  ----->  I kinda figured we’d lump them in the same category
Ian Fraser  ----->  Possibly, didn't think that's what Keaton meant tho.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Moving update........im tired of the F...ing rain.....end of update lol.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Moving in the rain stinks!
Sam Kawell  ----->  Alright I'm predicting PvP drops today. Probly at 3
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes pls
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Has the update been forced yet? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like for iOS?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Didn't that have to happen before they dropped it last time? 
Sam Kawell  ----->  They normally force it the morning before it drops
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ah OK. Well I hope they force it soon. I'm ready for something new
Ian Fraser  ----->  Unfortunately no way. I don't have the update in the play store yet and I'm not sure it's even out for ios 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Cary hall is battle 3 times for rare. Alpha pokes didn't seem to find quests today. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Manta bot might go out in the freezing weather later
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Boo. Maybe alpha will find them later.  That happened once last week. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's still posting pokes and gyms. Hope if finds some quests
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  One day he posted on discord that quests were glitchy that day. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Ian Fraser why did you have to ruin all my hopes and dreams
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ian likes to do that
Ian Fraser  ----->  "senator, ruining hopes and dreams is our speciality" 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sorry don't have time to actually find and modify the meme atm
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I kinda want to donate money to alph if it will help with consistency but Keven would kill me! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Tell him it's for a good cause! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m not sure he would agree
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think Carroll would be on Keven's side... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just wish it didn't fail on such a miserable day weather wise
Darren May  ----->  I’m up to 5 people that I could hit best with but I have no energy or desire to coordinate 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol just let it happen. Tell em go when everr
Darren May  ----->  I have the gifts to open this time. A million xp at my fingertips
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What a waste. Manta bot went around campus in the cold rain and not much to show for it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lots of not shiny gastly tho.... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve seen several not shiny misdreavus today 😞
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I forget those are shiny. I need to check those... 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Zero shiny misdreavus out of 20+ that i shiny checked today
Sam Kawell  ----->  1/450 guys....
Keaton Rhea  ----->  U gotta let everyone be salty! 
Darren May  ----->  Anyone know pokemonunion? Just got a friend request from them
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Never heard of them. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or seen the name to be honest
Sam Kawell  ----->  Check it! My brother and I spent way too much time with tweezers and sprinkles
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is really good! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Way better than I could ever do
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have the fine motor skillz of a toddler. My soldering is awful
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So if I want raid passes (and really that is all I care about), am I better off buying them individually until we get a non shit box? Or do I just take the cheap incubators? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I like the incubators 🤷🏼‍♀️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean I have like 10 super saved up... 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  10? (Laughs in super incubator)
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I say, do it. 👍 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  ...... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Joe u got a dust and spending problem! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  10 is plenty of for me 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Twas my birfday not long ago. Them gift cards are the gift that keep on giving. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Too bad my family won't give me gift cards... 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ll make sure to get ya one on your birthday. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Fam. It has a money value! Me. Umm I can Google what u got and see price.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  One of my only two Google play cards ever came from something I  should not of even accepted. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I didn't deserve it
Blaine, E  ----->  If you are referring to community day, you did Keaton
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope I didnt
Ian Fraser  ----->  LET YOURSELF BE APPRECIATED 
Blaine, E  ----->  Let yourself be blessed!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No. It was supposed to be a donation. I shouldn't of taken anything in return... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  It was a donation for a donation. Checkmate.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Donations do not deserve anything in return. 
Blaine, E  ----->  Don't argue, I will slap you
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Slap me. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I won't ever fight back
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I feel the way I feel. 
David Busby  ----->  I’m not sure whether I say FIGHT or HUG in this situation 
David Busby  ----->  39 best and I’m still third in this group
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  How many besties are you up to @Keaton Rhea ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only 40
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I hit two more today
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have 43 but I’m slowing down. My next two are 3 and 7 days out. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  After today for me it's 4, 6, 10 days. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And 11. Then it falls off a cliff
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Those that I numbered are very unreliable too. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I need new friends. I've added a few casuals (like sub 30) for celebi quest a while out. We are like half way to ultra lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have a few more consistent friends but they were added later so we’re not even close to best. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes same. I'm close on sabi! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  17 days with Sabi 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  10 for me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I just spent 27 great balls on a sudowoodo..... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I got em
Ian Fraser  ----->  Gotta name it DieSuwoodoDie
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He got turned into candy
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I'm sure my brothers would love to have a reliable gift giver like you as a friend if you like
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I'll add! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  8168 1924 5664
Sam Kawell  ----->  Sweet. I'll get their digits
Keaton Rhea  ----->  7477 0756 3379
Sam Kawell  ----->  That'll be easier
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yesssssssssss
Keaton Rhea  ----->  OooOOOoOoooOooo
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Update deletes all ur battle parties... Rip
Darren May  ----->  19 updates and none are pogo
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F for ipoopy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't think PvP is actually live yet tho
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh lol no. That's a serverside switch. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They need to get it out on ipoopy store so we can play
David Busby  ----->  I work 3 today til close tomorrow. Bet it drops while I’m at work and I don’t get to play during the level 40 only time 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just clock in and hide in the back and remote battle! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ll remote battle you late at night!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Has any one mentioned how remote battle works? Like do they get a push notification? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or do u have to communicate with them beforehand so that ur on at the same time? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  No one knows. I would expect the latter tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But what if I want to curb stomp my friends in PvP and they are not responding to my messages? I need a way to spam more notifications... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I sure Taylor will always be there for you. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also looks like RIP pvp happening today 
Ian Fraser  ----->  New boxes. They're crap. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Umm those are way better than last one. I'll prob get this one
Ian Fraser  ----->  LOL some dummy didn't load in the ultra box originally 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Those boxes are amazing
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is 80 cents for 10 eggs and 12 incubators in my book
Ian Fraser  ----->  No that box is hype. Originally you could only see the Winter and Great box in store. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh i don't even check those most of the time
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have zero eggs so I like this one. Those star pieces are trash tho
Ian Fraser  ----->  Sigh I don't have bag space for this crap 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have bag space but not enough coins 😞
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll make bag space
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Max revives good bye
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Need to do more surveys. Guess I’m not gonna finish GOT before I have to return it. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If I get desperate enough I'll dump rares into trash like Sui 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  At least dump them into ttars or ray ray. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ehh but the Sui is a hundo.... 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  2 da top
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can't always be smart about my spending
Joseph Spalding  ----->  🔝🔝
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I could load up the iTunes gift card “Santa” bought for my stocking. It wouldn’t be very fun to open on Christmas though. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Take it out of the package, redeem, then tape it back up and open it on xmaw! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Xmas*
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s what I was thinking. 🤫 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  U still open something! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Carroll and I might of already exchanged our big gifts lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We do it for show really bc kids
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh I know. That was the best thing growing up. Now it's just us the dogs (for now). They don't seem to mind
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That and her fitbit was not charging and my PMP was not syncing new music.... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We mostly just buy anything we need/want so when it starts to get close to Christmas we put those things on an amazon wish list and e-mail them to each other. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We do similar. Email subject lije. 'I need dis' 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like*
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We've become so casual with the move I'm trying to decide if it's worth going to spin a stop lol.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Won’t let me remote berry since I updated. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Oh never mind. I was actually kicked out 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm sad to report in was to tired to go spin a stop lol. Probably only 4 or 5 days thats happened since we started playing. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Blaine, E Did a lil cleaning of the ol storage tonight and stumbled upon these friendly pokes... 😉
Blaine, E  ----->  I was wondering if you ever saw them! 🤗
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I was in no way responsible for the above pokemon name message... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What happens when you eat something you are not supposed to.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just 5 manned a cress. Me, Jr., lvl 24, 25, 23. That was close
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The 3 of them had already wasted pass. Glad I didn't waste mine too! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I added them as friends too. Omg the stats. They make jr look OP
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip alpha didn't get stops again. Manta bot needs to go out this afternoon! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Is this a new gym?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  The one with the sneasel raid. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yes
Ian Fraser  ----->  Has to be, my bus goes by there every day 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Gonna have to come of casual mode for 2 weeks lol.
Darren May  ----->  Xmas break gonna be wild now
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Spots at the red barn!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Two silver pinap on campus. Foy and peace. Will post on Lee's site
Darren May  ----->  Mantabot Error Log: it’s carved microscope not foy 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I posted right one on website. Memory not good so I save screen shots lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Really not jack squat on campus. 
Darren May  ----->  Unitarian church is also silver pinap. Picked it up after collecting on 3 silver pinap quests
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've been saving that ditto quest from the other day so I've been doing two silver pinap at a time... 
Blaine, E  ----->  Um, what. But also, why??
Ian Fraser  ----->  Ah I see you've met the final boss 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is the new PvP screen. U battle irl paras and u can't win
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Whoa 😯 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Those eyes. Stare right into your soul
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You better watch out Emily. He gonna get ya
Blaine, E  ----->  Who's Emily?
David Busby  ----->  THERES A NEW GYM?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  At the red barn on Donahue
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oops. Blaine*
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not like everyone one does already know... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  She introduced herself to me as as Emily...
David Busby  ----->  I just put two and two together from groupme and seeing her at raids. Then she referred to herself as Emily one time and I got super confused and thought she was talking about the other Emily’s 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That is y she does it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Emily R VS Emily B in pharm
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That nametag she wears gave it away well before it was a joke
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Too bad she puts the faded name tag on top... The one behind it is much better 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  She introduced herself as Emily and then told me her name on GroupMe. Maybe she only tries to confuse the boys. 🤷‍♀️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  At one point we had Emily R, B, O who were all pretty active in our group too
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No she told me her name in person! I just mess up on grewp me
Blaine, E  ----->  I intentionally wear the faded one because no one needs to be subjected to view the awful picture 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's not awful! Have some confidence. I got some spare to give away
Keaton Rhea  ----->  U saw my tiger card. Now that is awful 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Don't think it even works. Thing is like 10 yrs old. Pre-beard times. Those were dark indeed
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And yes, I've not shaved in 10 yrs
Blaine, E  ----->  Is the confidence in the beard...?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Always 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah pretty much the only thing I got going 
David Busby  ----->  Y’all do not want to see me without a beard 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Same
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No shave Nov fresh yr. Never changed 
Blaine, E  ----->  I have seen a picture of you without one Keaton, but imma need a picture for proof from you David!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Baby face is an understatement 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  About once a year Keven grows a beard and I hate it at first but then I get used to it and he looks so weird when he finally shaves 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like how she agrees that it's awful with out lol. So bad
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Look at his Facebook page @Blaine, E       
David Busby  ----->  I’ve had facial hair since I could grow patchy crap back when I was 13
David Busby  ----->  Y u gotta do that to me I thought we were cool @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve never claimed to be cool
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She is cool
Blaine, E  ----->  Omg you look so young 😱
Also, how do you know Nate johnson??
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You told me about your Facebook page
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don't look terrible without the beard. Just really really young. Now me with only a  mustache...that's bad. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Mustache is bad Ian. Never
Blaine, E  ----->  Never shave ever again @Ian Fraser 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Mine grows in all white trashy except for the horseshoe
David Busby  ----->  I did research with dr Vishnu (not even gonna try to spell his last name) in the pharm school and he was in there with me 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Joseph Spalding i did chin strap for a while. The stache is annoying at times. Was better but I felt like I looked dumb unless it was clean 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That’s all i have that’s worth a shit, brother. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But legitimately, if I shaved, I don't think some ppl would even recognize me at a raid. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Doubtful. Except for the orange and grey gear. lol
Blaine, E  ----->  Well I remember when you told me shaved your beard and head - and my brain hurt trying to imagine it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Orange for life 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But yes. I am disturbed thinking about me being bald and shaved too
Ian Fraser  ----->  I forgot I had shaved at the beginning of this semester. Someone told me it was "more professional" or some hogwash. But yea the mustached is actually a requirement lol.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Why would you shave your head...?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol bc she believed it
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It was a joke
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And she just went with it
Ian Fraser  ----->  Gotem
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She accepted it and I kept it going for like a day... Until she saw me
Blaine, E  ----->  Well why in the world would you joke about that?!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Right. Why would you shave your head?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I dont know. I thought it was obvious... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  At least ur head is smooth! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I bet mine is a lumpy cone head 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Razor smooth. And it was a pain in the ass. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We will never know until I can't choose how much hair I have
Keaton Rhea  ----->  https://www.boredpanda.com/holiday-cards-christmas-tradition-bergeron-family-2018/?utm_source=wisebrother&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=organic&fbclid=IwAR3VrtP9kp1rT6FEu4JwPVpYQJzSjgjEcx9rEhJkyrURMr-rcI_CDzcsrF4
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Omg. Carroll and I need to start this
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like now
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yaaaasss
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We know a family that does something similar. I’ll have to see if I can find any of their pictures on facebook 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes pls! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Should I tell West he’s gettin weird?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pls stop the bleeding 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Privately?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No idea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can't handle this
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Maybe let it bleed out... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He has no idea how weird he is being
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He drunk again? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t know
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost  he misunderstood the client side update for the server side button.
Sam Kawell  ----->  I dunno, I kind of see his point. Jazzy and whoever is on the chat late often have weird semi-gay conversations. Especially when pseudo was here. I don't think his comments are that much weirder than the regular late night chat, he just is less proficient at reading the room
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It does imply that it’s out
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Oooh drama let me go look. Yes my life is sad lol.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Elizabeth... We r going down a dark path
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Are there any mystic 40s not in this group? I know there have been non 40s. I'm to casual to be in the other cool kid groups lol.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yea a few 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t think this was ever meant to be a group for everyone who is level 40. That’s my understanding anyway. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I wasn’t 40 when I was added. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Me Blaine and Michelle only got 40 recently lol 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s true. Ian and Michelle were in here before me. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Cindy R Let me know what time is good for you and I’ll tell Matt. 
Cindy R  ----->  Whew...I managed to coordinate opening 4 Best friends on one egg.  That will never happen again..lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :( Cindy back. She gonna pass me! 
Cindy R  ----->  Nothing to worry about @Keaton Rhea ...still casual.  Didnt even play until the egg was up.  So much work to get done...LOL
Sam Kawell  ----->  My brother already got a sinnoh stone from losing to me....
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I lost and got a sinnoh stone. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I got lucky and sent out a ttar when he used Zapdos and raikou. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Not so fun fact: there is no warning (aside from it telling you the cp after powering up) that powering up your poke will move him to a new tier
Darren May  ----->  Hey someone battle me real quick. Taking a break from the kitchen. Made homemade KitKats for the office and now have to do dishes because our dishwasher died today
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Incoming 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m backing out @Darren May it shouldn’t take this long
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It's chow time. Till we get the fence finished at the new place, having to hang with them here every evening.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Sry bout that uneven fite @Darren May 😂 
Darren May  ----->  I have bad news to report. Nidoking and Blastoise still bad
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I was just excited to win 😂
Darren May  ----->  In both fights nidoking went down amazingly fast and my Blastoise anchor walked into an electric type. Guess I’ll have to beat up on Snookems to figure out what I’m doing
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I just lost to StarlyteGlimmer and she put in girafarig 😂
David Busby  ----->  Taking gyms @Matt Inger 
David Busby  ----->  Not sure how long ago you’d requested that tho lol
Matt Inger  ----->  I just did, it seems to be going through pretty quick 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ve got one more left in me before i head off to bed. Someone Fite me!
Cindy R  ----->  What's the new attack?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Joseph Spalding I accepted but it didn’t take apparently 
Darren May  ----->  Random from dragonites pool I think. Then you can Tm either. I think
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ve accepted yours twice now. Lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I guess it’s being glitchy. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I was in battle with @Matt Inger when you sent the first
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You killed me!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  🤣
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Harry don’t play
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Cindy lost twice then lost interest lol
David Busby  ----->  Jeeeeeeezus that’s a lot more dust than I was expecting
David Busby  ----->  I was hoping for like 40k tops
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And lots of candy too
David Busby  ----->  Only 10k for Gary hmmm
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Darren May Hannah would like that KitKat recipe
Darren May  ----->  https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/01/homemade-kit-kat-bars-recipe.html
Darren May  ----->  @Sam Kawell 
Sam Kawell  ----->  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/a5r1kf/pvp_move_data_from_game_master/?utm_source=reddit-android
Sam Kawell  ----->  So with the entrance of PvP they changed the stats for moves so you can basically forget everything you've ever learned about DPS. This guy's charts should help you get an idea of who is good now. Also, an observation I had last night is charge moves that take very little energy to charge (even if their dps is less) will likely do more overall damage bc your opponents two shields will be able to block less overall damage. So dragon claw is basically op now
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea @David Busby  Are you going to try and solo a ttar now? Just saw the video that it’s possible 
David Busby  ----->  I’ve heard you can do absol
David Busby  ----->  Didn’t know about ttar
David Busby  ----->  But yes. Absolutely lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes of course I will
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I saw absol as well but I thought the comments shower that ttar would be stupid hard but a possibly 
Darren May  ----->  Looks pretty tough but possible 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I throw Champs at it and see. Wish I did the Wilmore one earlier 
Darren May  ----->  It is so crazy to me to think about doing it solo when I remember struggling to do it with 5 or 6 people
David Busby  ----->  Power creep real
David Busby  ----->  And then we couldn’t even catch the damn things
Darren May  ----->  I had busby level salt the first time I missed a ttar
David Busby  ----->  I got a 10-11-11 as my first one after my like 7th raid and pumped all the dust and candy I had into it 
Darren May  ----->  @David Busby Twins bruh
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If I could duo ttar with Kaitlin’s account that would make me very happy. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And I still can’t catch the stupid things half the time. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @David Busby I did a absol this morning just mine and huckleberry, a solid minute left only on 3 champ.
Cindy R  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ I see...leave my poor acct out while I am slaving at home...LOL 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😍
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :) I'm happy about it. Now if only I had a sinnoh stone 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m hoping for another. And a shiny
Ian Fraser  ----->  Need to do more dueling! 
Darren May  ----->  Can someone tell me how the Meltan box works? I thought I saw some comments on silph about tricks to maximize it but idk
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I'm on for a few minutes if someone wants to battle
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Send me one Daniel 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I will @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol good battle 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So sad....lol
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost i sent you a battle
Ian Fraser  ----->  So fun facts: my apartment complex houses a single spawn point nest. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Cindy R it errored. Try again? 
Cindy R  ----->  You got me! Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol good one 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Joe almost got me
Joseph Spalding  ----->  KHHHHHHAAAAAAN! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  or should I say AZZZZZZUMARIL!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve lost every battle today. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Dang that thing is hard to kill
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth check big grewp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Get the salt
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’s flowing
Cindy R  ----->  I have only won 1 out of 4...lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rip doesn't look like domikenzen updated for new SE
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Prob won't be able to make dank charts
Darren May  ----->  F
Darren May  ----->  Smackdown ttars right?
Ian Fraser  ----->  For ho. B/c for Lugia I think 
Darren May  ----->  Why isn’t smackdown good for lugia too? #casual
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought smack down was the way to go. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Could be wrong just repeating what I first saw on TSR. I'll check later 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  SD is good for both if u want to have one team for both, but B/C is still good. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  C being a 3 bar is usually preferred in raids, but as long as lugia doesn't have HP, u should be getting off multiple SE
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think raikou is still the best for lugia tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  
Intro:
This is a simple guide to player versus player (PvP) in Pokémon Go (PoGo).  It is intended to be a beginner’s guide and thus will not include any numbers or calculations.  More advanced discussions on PvP will be mostly likely be better covered elsewhere (or by Sam).  While PvP may seem complicated, it can be thought of as a simple game of rock, paper, scizor (lol). There is always a counter to your Pokémon no matter how strong they are. PvP is meant to be a fun way to interact with your friends, so do not be discouraged if you do not understand all the concepts from the beginning.  Just have fun!

Keaton Rhea  ----->  Shields:
In PvP, when to use your shield is one of the most important things to consider.  You do not want to use both of your shields up to early, leaving you vulnerable to stronger charge attacks later in the battle.  In general, you do not want to use your shield if you think you can survive the hit.  The best times to use the shield is if you think you can get off one extra charge move.  One extra charge move can be crucial to gaining momentum and taking control of the match.  Another good time to use a shield is if you are trying to live a super effective charge move and you can return a neutral or super effective charge move.  Sometimes it is best to just let you Pokémon faint and save the charge for the 2nd or 3rd Pokémon.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Charge Moves:
The charge move you choose in PvP is very different from raids or gyms. In PvP, three bar moves are usually the best, regardless of how much damage they do.  Two bar moves are generally good to use, especially ones such as meteor mash, wild charge, dynamic punch, or any of the community day starter moves. These moves charge up quickly and do significant damage if the opponent runs out of shields.  It is advisable to avoid all the one bar moves.  While these moves have the highest damage per strike, they can easily be shielded and take too long to charge up.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Quick Moves:
There are two stats to consider when choosing which quick moves are best, which are damage per second (DPS) and energy-gain per second (EPS).  In raids and gyms, you generally want to maximize DPS; however, in PvP, EPS tends to be more important.  This is because the EPS determines how quickly your Pokémon can get off his/her charge move.  The more charge moves you can get off, the more likely you are to force you opponent to use their shields too early. A majority of the battles can be won by simply getting off more charge moves than your opponent.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  General Strategy:
In PvP, the winner of the match is the one that maximizes the total damage output (TDO) and has the best type coverage.  The TDO of a Pokémon is how much damage it can dish out before it faints.  In PvP, this is typically maximized by picking 2 or 3 bar charge moves with the best EPS quick move.

The second important thing to consider is type coverage.  You do not want a full team of the same type Pokémon with same type moves.  You want to vary the typing of the Pokémon and the moves they use.  Better type coverage can be achieved by adding a move slot to your Pokémon, but this can be very costly in terms of candy and stardust.  Instead, I suggest looking at some of the classic type coverage combinations from the main series.  The idea is to pick two or three moves that provide the most neutral or super effective coverage.  An example of these is electric and ice or ground and rock. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  An excellent way to learn some of these can be seen in the type charts (google “Pokémon type chart”).  The way to read these is to look at your attacking charge move and see what types this move is bad against (resisted).  You will then want to choose a second Pokémon or move that is either neutral or super effective versus this type.  As you can see in the chart, electric is resisted by electric, grass, ground, and dragon. Therefore, this move would best be pair with ice since ice is neutral or super effective versus all these types.  This gets more complicated when you have to consider dual typing Pokémon; however, it is a good starting point. It may seem daunting, but it is really best to memorize this chart so you can choose when/if you should switch Pokémon.

Keaton Rhea  ----->  Since the goal of PvP is to outlast you opponent, you want to try to get them to use their shields as early as possible.  This is best by always leading the battle with a Pokémon with a 3 bar move and high EPS.  When doing this, you are hoping your opponent uses up all their shields on their first Pokémon leaving them exposed for the rest of the match.  At the same time, you want to save you shields for as long as possible.  If you think you can survive the opponents charge move, then you a best off at not using a shield.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost @Amanda @Blaine, E @Michelle U @pleb
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just something simple
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You couldn’t put this into a nice neat info graphic or something to make it easy?  Gah 🙄
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol nope 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Bc there isnt really an ideal set up
Sam Kawell  ----->  That's a pretty good summary (even if it's super long)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The format on grewp me kinda makes it look worse than it is. It's only a little over a page on word lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  I've been going over may ways to get the ideal set of pokes and it's impossible due to type advantages. You can choose the best generalist team by maximizing your type coverages, but no team covers all.
Sam Kawell  ----->  Bc they buffed super effective damage, it opens the door for creativity, so I'm very glad they did it that way, but unfortunately I don't see there being one formula to choose the best team
Joseph Spalding  ----->  TLDR
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's really not possible. Even with the best generalist team, u can be hard countered 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Tldr for Joe. Use one bar moves and make sure u waste ur shields
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And always do not very effective dmg
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I actually read it, but felt the need to be edgy
Sam Kawell  ----->  There will likely be a meta eventually but bc they make the leagues based off of cp and not level, I can see the meta being much more broad than in other competitive stuff
Sam Kawell  ----->  Which I approve of 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ll read it later.  Are there really no raids right now or is alpha not working? Headed to the store and was hoping to use my pass for the day. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There are definitely a handful of mons that are good. But when u can only choose 3, it gets kinda difficult to make the best combo 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost davis is all I see on campus
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Alpha is not working 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Boo
David Busby  ----->  Zach and I were talking last night and it appears Gary will be one of the best generalists around. You can run dark and dragon charge moves on him for just 10k dust
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Hasn’t helped me today. I suck at pvp 😢
David Busby  ----->  How often do you restart app between battles? Also not gonna lie I tap like Susan now 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gary is hard countered by guard
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But yes Gary is cheap and good
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And rai is very common
David Busby  ----->  Oh he’s a third poke I’d use to surprise folks before I see raikou in everyone’s teams 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  There will always be a counter with teams of only 3. Makes it fun
David Busby  ----->  I’ve been doing rounds of three and round 2 is always super interesting. Did they counter my team one or counter what they thought I’d use to counter them with. Feel like I’ll start to realize what individuals use and shielding tendencies and such
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Typing is my problem. I just can’t keep them all straight. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Those charts are handy to keep saved
Sam Kawell  ----->  just to be nitpicky, those 1/2's should be 1.6, the 2's should be 1.625 and the 0's should be 0.39
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I also can’t remember which Pokémon are which type. The big ones I remember but in pvp people are using random stuff that I don’t know. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yeah, I really wish they had some sort of interface that would show us the type(s) and moves of our pokes when selecting them
Ian Fraser  ----->  What matters more: 1atk IV or 9cp?
Sam Kawell  ----->  What are the IVs for the two pokes?
Ian Fraser  ----->  96 VS 89
Sam Kawell  ----->  I meant each number atk def hp
Ian Fraser  ----->  15/11/14 VS 14/15/14
Sam Kawell  ----->  For PvP I'd go with the second one
Ian Fraser  ----->  So higher CP over atk IV. That's what I thought but thought it might be worth asking. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They could just add two little icons to the pokemon when selecting. Like a rock icon let's u know it has a rock QM
Cindy R  ----->  Spots at the new gym
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If any one wants a pdf of the text wall I sent earlier, just DM me ur email
Darren May  ----->  Holy! Double candy for transfers!!!!
Darren May  ----->  Holiday event. New in-game notification 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I want to try to raid them shiny ho and lugia tomorrow. Prob like an hr or so around 10 or 11am. Let me know if anyone is interested in getting a small Mystic party going
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dom is still not updated but I think lugia won't be as huge of a pain as b4
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm also not afraid of trying a duo of Mr ho
David Busby  ----->  Same
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've got 4 lvl 40 SD ttar and a lvl 40 hundo SD rhyperior 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll go for it even if it's SB bc I've got jr to save us
GroupMe  ----->  Blaine, E has left the group.
Darren May  ----->  F
David Busby  ----->  Spots new gym
David Busby  ----->  Wait wtf 
David Busby  ----->  Why she leave
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She needs less distractions
Ian Fraser  ----->  She probably just trying to focus 
Sam Kawell  ----->  *fewer
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We too interesting 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Close enough 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not like I have any publications lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  Alright there Stannis
Sam Kawell  ----->  It's comments like that that are just too distracting
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My English is bad
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thank goodness for spell check and grammar suggestions 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would of never published anything without it
GroupMe  ----->  Blaine, E has rejoined the group
Blaine, E  ----->  Everything is a distraction when I am working on school things outside of school time 😅 archiving it doesn't fool me enough to not look there. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Would love to join tomorrow morning. I’ll have to see if I can work something out. I would like a good lugia and a shiny. A good shiny is probably asking too much.  
Matt Inger  ----->  I would like to join in the morning as well
Keaton Rhea  ----->  All of u guys are welcome join ! The more the better. 
David Busby  ----->  I’ll raid in the morning if I wake up on time lol
David Busby  ----->  And this makes me a terrible person but I say we tell defib we’re raiding but not Taylor 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We’ll probably see him if he’s out and he will know. 
Cindy R  ----->  Wish we could join yall...catch a good one for us!
Darren May  ----->  @Michelle U Opening your gift now 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Keaton Rhea @Blaine, E Wanted to let you two know I’m going to the range on Sunday if either of you wants to go

Joseph Spalding  ----->  Bout 16 miles
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Range??? What range?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  My gun club @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ you and cindy are more than welcome to come too
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Is it hand gun only? Been looking for some long range rifle practice. I've been wanting to take Cindy for years. We need to explore some different calibers and see what's comfortable for her.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  We have 10 25 meter bays that you can shoot anything tou like
Joseph Spalding  ----->  2 100 yard and 1 300 rifle ranges
Joseph Spalding  ----->  3 15 meter pistol bays with shooting steel
Joseph Spalding  ----->  1 50 meter anything goes bay 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  And even an archery lane
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sounds like a relaxing place lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It’s wonderful
Joseph Spalding  ----->  lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve arranged for the in-laws to keep the kiddos in the morning so I get to come out and raid. Yay!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  When we get settled we'll have to come hand out. Do you rent out guns/ammo as well.
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I don’t own it, just a member. But I have a wide variety of calibers in my collection 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Joseph Spalding I would be down to go if that's not too late. Also do I bring anything?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  You’re off at 6pm?
Blaine, E  ----->  Yes 6 est
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That might be too late as all shooting stops at sunset
Blaine, E  ----->  Bummer, I never work sundays usually 
David Busby  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost @Joseph Spalding thanks for not making me look like an idiot #realfriends 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So everybody can beat my ass
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Who loves you, bby 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Too many lugias this morning. I hope there are more when we go out. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Spots bee lab, frat house, camo, bridge 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr OP
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Bee lab has 10 min till raid starts just FYI 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll be back out close to 10 looking for them shiny. Let me know if anyone wants to join
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Me and james are headed in to town to slay some legendaries!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I hope James gets some shiny! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  As soon as my backup gets here, I’ll had out. Where do you think you’ll start @Keaton Rhea ?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess I'll keep an eye on big grewp 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I'll meet Emily at Felton to start
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  There’s lugia and ho at the museum until 10:19 with another t5 hatching at 10:16
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll see if I can make those
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It depends on when I can leave the house
Ian Fraser  ----->  20 mins left in Lugia at Bridge
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m here now. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I might be able to come depending on how quickly Catie leaves Starbucks but don't wait for me if you have people 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  There’s a group going in now. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Okay nvm then lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t think the three of us could do. But I
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don't think so either. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Is there a second one? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Second raid? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes at museum? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes at tractor wing
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I mean camo
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can do that one
Joseph Spalding  ----->  We’re just getting on 85
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Be at museum in a few 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Camo is lugia!  Yay!
Blaine, E  ----->  Zion has a lugia that just hatched as well
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You guys wanna do museum then Zion?
David Busby  ----->  Time for museum?
Blaine, E  ----->  Yes for us @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->   Haven’t set one. When can you get here @David Busby 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  We will be there in 10
David Busby  ----->  Finishing up at Hardee’s someone set a time in big group
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Just got on college 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Tractor wing stop is silver pinap btw
Ian Fraser  ----->  Catie and I can do zion
Ian Fraser  ----->  Have you all finished up at Camp yet or still waiting? 
Blaine, E  ----->  Heading to zion @Ian Fraser 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby @Elizabeth Kidd Yost both doing zion? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  On our way
Ian Fraser  ----->  Is there a reason to not use Metagross at great league? Seems like he resists a butt ton and takes down ice mons 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks for the raids today! :) 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's rare for me to get on a raid train like that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And yes. Metagross is good in all lvls
David Busby  ----->  @Sam Kawell Doesn’t your wife love furrets?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Where did u see these?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Asking for a friend.... 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Oh wow. That's adorable
Sam Kawell  ----->  What Keaton said...
David Busby  ----->  https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/a6h0v3/i_make_plushies_i_think_im_pretty_good/?st=JPPYRBYZ&sh=dc28b90a
David Busby  ----->  I don’t think she’s selling them
David Busby  ----->  I assume girl? Idk why
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Everybody has thier price
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost big grewp
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😤 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Keaton’s trying to make me extra salty by tagging me every time somebody posts one. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Check Etsy for Pokémon plushies. There’s always lots of stuff like that. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What? That doesnt sound like me
Blaine, E  ----->  You wanting a shiny misdreavus @Elizabeth Kidd Yost ?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes. She’s one of my faves. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve been doing as many of those quests as I can but a lot of them have been where I can’t get to them easily. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Same. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Well sorry not one of my fav but I want a shiny 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Who put in a machoke?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Prob best she got lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It'd her, me, and Jose 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Its*
Matt Inger  ----->  So in regards to PvP, can we confirm that losing helps with getting a stone?   I got my first today losing my first two.  Then my son got one when he lost the third.  It seems to be a trend based on what I’ve been hearing.  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  So start losing battles. Seems like a good idea
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've gotten zero 
Matt Inger  ----->  Also any recommendations on good fighters?   Lugia and Metagross seem to work well based on my little experience.  I’d like a 3 bar to open with. Besides Ttar, Golem, and Latios, any other good 3 bars that y’all can think of?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’ve gotten three and I’ve lost most of my battles. The third one I got from training though and I won that one. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Depending on tier, but mew has like 3 or 4 3 bar moves lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sceptile leaf blade, fossils with ancient power, golem rock blast 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Tina w/ Dt and SS
Matt Inger  ----->  Sceptile is an interesting one.  I was thinking a good grass fighter might be useful. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sceptile gets bullet seed and leaf blade. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Leaf blade is also good on victrebell
Matt Inger  ----->  Sceptile also has AA for only 10k dust
Matt Inger  ----->  Scizor could be an option too. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Scizor and pinsir
Ian Fraser  ----->  From what I've heard I would opt for Frenzy Plant over prioritizing a three bar move 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not for lead
Keaton Rhea  ----->  3bar better
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But for late game, FP OP
Sam Kawell  ----->  Basically all Kanto starters are excellent choices
Sam Kawell  ----->  With cd moves though
Blaine, E  ----->  So, if I fought but my bag was full and I didn't get a "prize", am I able to fight again to get something? If my wording made sense...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Fight again
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just attack me now if u need it 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Empty bag first! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only 3 drops per day
Blaine, E  ----->  Okay! Make it a real fight though! Dont throw those low cp shinies at me!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I do what I want! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But ok
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol... 
Blaine, E  ----->  😱 you mean an all gengar team isn't OP
Blaine, E  ----->  Lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope it got stomped on
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sorry! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Did u even read the guide? 
Blaine, E  ----->  Oh no not yet lol.  It was between all gengars or rats. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :(
Blaine, E  ----->  Why sad face? I will read it now!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  About time
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sad bc u don't read what I gave u to get better 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  How do we reeeeeeeeeach theeeese keeeeeeeeds
Blaine, E  ----->  I haven't had time! Chris did look over at me to see why I was furiously tapping though 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  Freaking weirdo over here 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll give u a dank pdf if u dm me ur email.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But u already read it so it's prob a waste
Blaine, E  ----->  I'm only half way through but so far it is very helpful and well organized!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Let me know if u give up and just want badge. I'll rat it up again
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I think u will get it! 
Blaine, E  ----->  I do still want badge lol. I think the typing will be hardest for me to get down/remember
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's ez peazy 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just a few things to remember. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll gladly be cannon fodder otherwise 
Blaine, E  ----->  Well as I typed that I realized that is pretty much all of what PvP is about - so the whole thing will be hard for me to get down...😅
Ian Fraser  ----->  That's basically right. It's like 80% memorizing. Gonna take a minute but you'll (and I) will get it down lol 
Blaine, E  ----->  I think we will get it down with practice 🤷‍♀️ lots and lots of failed matches lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's super EZ
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just a few things
Blaine, E  ----->  Says you
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->   EZ he says 🙄
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Says all
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rock paper scizor
Ian Fraser  ----->  So scizor is the best Pokémon? Got it 
David Busby  ----->  According to @Joseph Spalding yes
Cindy R  ----->  So if I just wait until everyone gets their badge will you just let me win..LOL
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Battle me @Cindy R You’ll probably win for real!
Cindy R  ----->  Ok, let me log in
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Told ya!
Cindy R  ----->  That made my hand cramp I was hitting the screen so hard..bahaha
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Muh snow dawg!!!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Name her Emilynn! 
Blaine, E  ----->  I second that name!
Blaine, E  ----->  Dang Keaton, how are you still awake
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm not 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Waaaaaaaaay past your bedtime 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nah we can't be having name repeats. I vote something new and fresh. Like Stormageddon! 
Blaine, E  ----->  Shhhhh, we don't talk about that name
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It’s aStormalypse!
Sam Kawell  ----->  I know I'm late, but in addition to memorizing the type chart, which I would NOT label as easy peezy, you need to know the types of all pokes! And if you really want to be good, you should know all the potential moves for each poke and how long they will take to charge.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes. It’s too much for my scattered little brain
Cindy R  ----->  Right there with you Elizabeth lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What Sam said is correct. I will say it is way easier to do in PoGo vs main series. Main series you have 4 move slots, abilities, natures, status, plus the physical/special split to worry about. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Me saying type match ups is easy is a realitive statement. But I do not think it's super hard
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's not like I've battled thousands of times in the main series battle towers.... I definitely didn't learn anything from those
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ye! I'm gonna go hiking tomorrow on the deadening! Anyone done it? It's near Lake Martin 
Blaine, E  ----->  Where is that?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The Deadening Alpine Trailhead

Ian Fraser  ----->  BTW @Keaton Rhea im probably gonna hold off on opening Jr's gift unless you really want to hit best tomorrow 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No ill wait for as long as u want 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just gag me b4. I'll egg then close app
Ian Fraser  ----->  Kinky
Ian Fraser  ----->  But okay
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Omg I just read that. Sorry don't gag lol. Tag
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nope too late 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I kinda wanna kill jr for his 4 sinnoh stones 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ok go ahead. Gag
Blaine, E  ----->  😱 first time getting the stone and I got 2 😁
Michelle U  ----->  Christmas crafting 😁
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm a green jelly bean of both
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E who u battle? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Makes me feels bad
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Michelle U share with me? 
Blaine, E  ----->  Thank you for the raids Keaton
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Umm I did not raid today at all
Blaine, E  ----->  battle*
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Oh sorry I did that 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thank you! 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Ian Fraser We besties when i open this gift if you want to egg. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @Joseph Spalding you want me to come yours too?
Sam Kawell  ----->  *open
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Sure thing. Egg is on
Ian Fraser  ----->  Oh I hadn't even noticed lol. Uh sure. I'll line up others if you're got a couple tonight! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  How long for your egg?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  29 min. lol
Sam Kawell  ----->  Cool. I'll def open it in 10 minutes if Jose hasn't responded
Sam Kawell  ----->  Just opened @Joseph Spalding 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  @Ian Fraser Are you good for me to open?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yep.!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Done. I feel so... empty. 
With XP. 😂
Darren May  ----->  Since I only got to do 2 raids this weekend, I would trade a shiny ho-oh for a shiny lugia if someone was interested.
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've got a spare if you get desperate, Darren 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes two ho and two lugia for me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Or I can sign into some other account that had more luck... Like 4 shiny with only 20 raids... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That other account already offered one to me so don’t give away all her shiny lugias 😉
Darren May  ----->  Anyone have extra magnemites? I just finished my 10 raids and realized I don’t have any to evolve 
Sam Kawell  ----->  #CasualDarren
Darren May  ----->  Thanks @Matt Inger. Now looking for a cubone to catch. #TrustTheProcess
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Hey guys!  A couple of us were talking this morning and would like to add Mimiloma to mystic chat. Let me know your thoughts please 😁
Darren May  ----->  I’m fine with that. We could probably add that Jesse guy too
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think he leveled up to 30 at Baughman so he just makes the cut. 
Darren May  ----->  So are people giving their pokes the additional moves (besides drunk David)? I tried to read up on what’s good but it might be too much effort for casual Darren, and I’m stardust poor
Ian Fraser  ----->  Wait till the meta shakes out I'd say. I don't think it'll ever be a req for raiding. That said starters with CD are dang good in pvp and only cost 10,000 so if you really want to I'd focus on those. 
Darren May  ----->  I don’t really want to but @Elizabeth Kidd Yost was trash talking my Blastoise this morning 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I did get an extra move on my elekid before I evolved it since it was so cheap on the baby. I’m not sure electivire has a second good move but I did it anyway. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😂😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That was one of the few battles I won so use your blastoise as much as you want @Darren May 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I'm eyeing dumping dust into this Azuril I have right now.. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Blastoise with Hydro Cannon and Ice beam is pretty good. 
Darren May  ----->  Upon examination it was nidoking who was trash and put me in a hole
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've not put any moves on my pokes yet but I'm thinking about big dump on mew
Darren May  ----->  I may now have a Blastoise with hydro cannon and flash cannon and no tms. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well there's only one way to fix that! 
Darren May  ----->  Hey I did 3 raids today. I’m tired!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hatched my first budew today. I've gone casual with my dex
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I kept both phones in my pocket for my hike today for adventure synch. Main crashed after only 2km and alt kept going for a full 6.7km before it crashed. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  What do you mean it crashed?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like it just stops running in background 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I open it back up and niantsux logo
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I thought for adventure sync pogo had to be closed. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  No mine only tracks with Google fit and it running in background 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Otherwise I get zero 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Mines done that a few times in battery saver mode
Darren May  ----->  Hey casual Darren now needs omanytes/kabutos and lileeps/anoriths. #TrustTheProcess
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sadly trades don’t count
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think David said there’s a kabuto nest at the Jack Key Golf Training facility
David Busby  ----->  Haven’t seen one on the nearby for a minute 
David Busby  ----->  Saw them all day one day and called it out then it just stopped. But I’m not aware of a nest migration in that time 
Darren May  ----->  No rush really. I’m going to use my box tomorrow once double candy starts. Maybe samford will be a good nest again at some point. 
David Busby  ----->  Just super rare nest?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Gib me dat
David Busby  ----->  Like fr?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Still meltan questing, like the casual i am
David Busby  ----->  You’re lucky I like you lol
David Busby  ----->  I’m a couch potato rn 
Darren May  ----->  Where is that?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Lol. The casuals come out at night. 
David Busby  ----->  Way out north Donahue by my house
Sam Kawell  ----->  PSA: if you want to get an extra incubator today, don't spin anything until 3!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yeah right. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  U guys better watch out.... 
Matt Inger  ----->  Looks like fun!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Kaitlin got one on her first spin just now. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I got one on my first spin too. Yay! Niantic did something right for a change. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/a7bxar/free_incubators_live/?utm_source=reddit-android

Yep it's live 
Darren May  ----->  I can live with a lot of niantic’s suckery, but the amount of perks/rewards that require you to actively “not play” the game is incredibly annoying.
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  It's been 5 minutes since I saw the post of the new legend......whats super effective? Do we already have it lol? I hope so my star dust is lacking lol.
Ian Fraser  ----->  For real, five minutes and we don't even have a damage chart yet? Falling down on the job @Keaton Rhea 
Ian Fraser  ----->  But to answer your question @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ seems like Groudon - Rhyperior - water types are the way to go?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Actually instead of water types Kyogre - Machamp - then other water types 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  You know me and cindy always trying to figure out if we can 3 man one. With our limited time seems to be the only way we can raid these days.
Blaine, E  ----->  He's been busy @Ian Fraser 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No excuses!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  That curriculum definitely allowed. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ Me and huckleberry an become besties today 🤗
Darren May  ----->  Sees swampert in the heatran counters list
Sam Kawell  ----->  Dang, Groudon is by far the best available counter. It would be really nice if we had been able to get him anytime since last December...
Darren May  ----->  And there was no one around to raid for him then either
Darren May  ----->  Got no tms so may buy the extra move for him and hope for earthquake 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t have a good groudon 😕
Darren May  ----->  I have a couple if you want to try your luck trading 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Abomasnow is out! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Right when I get home and can't play anymore really at all until new years lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  So sad 😞 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Maybe I'll catch some in the air port traveling
Sam Kawell  ----->  One just spawned at work and had the audacity to run away
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What a total meany! The next one u see is probably him. Throw a rock instead of a pokeball just like safari zone 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E can u ask Chris if this is correct? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Tldr is use ground. Don't even try anything else lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Heatran can run air Ballon so it's toast
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I guess it’s time to evolve Rhyperior 
Blaine, E  ----->  He did have that numel 🤔 he is ready for the new raid  boss!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He needs to double check the numbers! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gotta make sure I did the mathz right. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Those in u/TheSilphArena are [already aware](http...

https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/a7d5ei/master_league_simplified_graphic/ec20dir?utm_source=reddit-android

Here's some good analysis of Master league for those who care! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What the big bois say ^^
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I like to try it out some! More fun to learn battle wise
Ian Fraser  ----->  I don't have the stardust for Master lol. Gotta dump all the stardust into Great league! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope. Dump it all! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm poor now :/
Ian Fraser  ----->  I'm already 200k poorer.. And I'm eyeing my Latios in Ultra like... 👀 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Where's that extra move? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Um. I was over 3M
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Respect the spending pls
Ian Fraser  ----->  Well I know you didn't spend it all taking a Moltres from 15 to like 23ish.. 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  That molt is lvl 19 son
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You must learn younger young padawan
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes both of those are needed
Ian Fraser  ----->  Soooo even less dust was spent lol. :p
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes. Only 1.5M was spent. Not counting what I gained back while playing
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Keaton’s poor and I’M RICH!!!!!!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Extra rich! Shiny >>>> stardust 
Blaine, E  ----->  🤔 I question both of your naming skills @Joseph Spalding @Keaton Rhea 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Our shenanigans are cheeky and fun! @Blaine, E 
Blaine, E  ----->  I don't disagree...I just question it 😝
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I actually won! Woot woot!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And got two sinnoh stones! Thanks @Joseph Spalding 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Damn. I got dust. This some bullshit. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Aw man. Gotta play taxi driver now. 
David Busby  ----->  I’ve actually spent no dust in master league aside from extra moves. But I’m just using the stuff I maxed for raids long ago
David Busby  ----->  Thoughts? Finish off number two Groudon and evolve rhydon?
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Finish that groudon 
Sam Kawell  ----->  @David Busby unless they have two charge moves, you want to make them earthquake. You're losing more than 30% DPS with solar beam
Sam Kawell  ----->  Actually, around 45%
David Busby  ----->  Oh they never got renamed 
David Busby  ----->  They’ve been eq since I tried the jolteon solo
Sam Kawell  ----->  Cool, if you have the candies, I would bring up a third. They really are the best counters by a lot
David Busby  ----->  I don’t but I have plenty of rares 
David Busby  ----->  I also have a 13/15/15 level 25 one or a 15/15/12 level 12 one that I’m tempted to bring to that first break point for best
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  We did trio 2 tonight with no problem and huckleberry groudon not even powered up.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  This is my best groudon. Is it worth doing anything to him?
Sam Kawell  ----->  0.3% dps below a perfect.....
Sam Kawell  ----->  Except for garchomp, Groudon does at least 10% more damage than anyone else, so I would say definitely yes
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I seriously want to cry right now. I was driving and accidentally gave an extra move to a 54% swinub. That’s 50k dust down the drain 😭 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Nooooooooo
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’m safe due to my dust habit!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I try to keep a buffer but I was getting kinda low. Now I only have 150k 😩
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I guess I’ll be tm-ing some golems 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  This is what I ended up with
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️does huckleberry wanna open my gift for besties? 
David Busby  ----->  Nooo
David Busby  ----->  No more besties for Elizabeth 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😢
David Busby  ----->  Just for some more salt @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I hate you
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol. Let the hate flow Elizabeth 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sorry @Elizabeth Kidd Yost i actually crashed early. The first chance I have to run an egg I'll get with you. 
Darren May  ----->  @Keaton Rhea I did not see nidoking on your chart. I assume this is an oversight and his dps is slightly above groudon?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No problem @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ i have a class Christmas party this morning so I won’t be on, but if you open just let me know and I will put out an egg when I open the app.  
Ian Fraser  ----->  This is like 3 weeks late but here's my family's :) 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Pretty! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So I was looking through the dregs of my friend list and I think 2+ days ago is an understatement....
Cindy R  ----->  Our tree is lame this year...its up but only lights on it.  I think we are gonna skip ornaments lol.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I didn’t put all the ornaments on this year but there are some. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Spots at red barn. It's just to early to be defending a gym 5 minutes after we took it lol.
Blaine, E  ----->  😁
GroupMe  ----->  Elizabeth Kidd Yost removed Blaine, E from the group.
GORT  ----->  Elizabeth Kidd Yost: removing users is not allowed! (warning #1)

GroupMe  ----->  David Busby added Blaine, E to the group.
David Busby  ----->  😂😂😂
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You have Gort in here @David Busby ?  Grrrrr
David Busby  ----->  I think I accidentally added it in here instead of mystic 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I hate you
Blaine, E  ----->  I'm sorry @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 😅
Blaine, E  ----->  I debated posting but I love her...
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t hate you @Blaine, E That was referring to David
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  She is one of my faves!
Blaine, E  ----->  Lol I know but I knew you were looking for it too!
Ian Fraser  ----->  He added gort in here because he has a habit of getting drunk and losing his phone around Jazzy. 😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also nice shiny! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  True @Ian Fraser 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Woot!  I can reach a gym and a stop from the hotel room. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No 8-hour rule in Nashville
Ian Fraser  ----->  You need to complain in their discord 
Blaine, E  ----->  Not in Asheville either @Elizabeth Kidd Yost !
Ian Fraser  ----->  You guys need to get those sweet middle-of-nowhere rest stops, that's the trick!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I got 3 coins! Someone add me to the Breck discord 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  You will never guess who got another sinnoh stone on his 7days breakthrough 
Blaine, E  ----->  I hope you opened that gift from team majestic...I have nonstop heard about people opening or not opening his gifts 🙄 #ragrets lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  I'll open the second one he's sent me today in 1.6km worth of shaking! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr and I got this on lock down. Gimme coins
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think I opened it! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He opened a gift from me today @Blaine, E I’ll open tomorrow. 
Blaine, E  ----->  Haha thanks! He will be fine either way
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol finally getting stones. I think the secret is to intentionally lose to get two lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  TSR says rate is something like 1/8. You beat that record tho right? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Um those are like my first stones outside one other time I think
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Who wants in on this b2b? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol zero raids for me
David Busby  ----->  Anyone want a nest of three in master pvp?
David Busby  ----->  Resend Matt
David Busby  ----->  I’m restarting app
David Busby  ----->  That was embarrassing. I usually plan for the ttar when I use a mewtwo first but I goofed bad 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  In his natural habitat! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Pretty!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Kinda.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gotta ski in this... 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  WTH is all that white stuff?  You better not be dragging any of that crap back with you!  Also, have fun!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm leaving it all here. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  That’s a wise decision. If you know what’s good for you, that is. 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Not pictured. 25+ mph winds at the base
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Gonna b bad at the top
Joseph Spalding  ----->  All your windy base are not belong to us!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The more layers of orange I wear, the warmer I will be, right? 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  The second law of thermodynamics says you’re correct!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  A raid finally popped in our hotel room gym when we were there and it was ttar!  I wanted to see if Kaitlin and I could duo but someone else hopped in with us. I think we could have done it though. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Kaitlin got this guy 😱 You should’ve seen me, I was so anxious about her catching it, even Keven could see my anxiety. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nice catch! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Looks cold
Ian Fraser  ----->  Looks like you took a faceplant lol
Ian Fraser  ----->  Also that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Nope that is snow on me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's snowing that hard. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Only fell once so far. I was standing up not moving.... 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That takes talent
David Busby  ----->  I’m pretty sure I could replicate that 😂
David Busby  ----->  Falling down without moving I mean lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Trust me, I'm going fast but I'm holding back to watch Carroll haha
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I do really well on the bunny slope
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Can’t seem to apply the skills to a real slope 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll survive double blacks just fine. But I'll get tied fast bc I'm out of shape
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I can’t decide which legendaries to keep/transfer 😩
Ian Fraser  ----->  I mean you get two candies for trading and then transferring so I'm not positive why I would just transfer. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  True. I didn’t think about that. The main reason I want to keep some is for trading   
David Busby  ----->  Wooo
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I do have 39 mewtwos though. Probably don’t need to hang on to all of them. 
David Busby  ----->  Unless they’re 96+, boosted, or shadow ball why you need them 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t. I just hate making decisions 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m working on it, but it’s hard
Ian Fraser  ----->  And we all know how well making decisions worked out for Anakin. 
Blaine, E  ----->  How hard is lapras to beat?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I got it down to 24. 15 of those have shadow ball. 
David Busby  ----->  I’d say two of us could do it with best friend bonus 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  She’s probably wondering if her and Chris could do it. 
Blaine, E  ----->  I know Chris and I couldn't but he doesnt have one
David Busby  ----->  Yea I figured.  I was trying to politely say no
Blaine, E  ----->  😂😂
Ian Fraser  ----->  No
David Busby  ----->  How much time on it 
Blaine, E  ----->  22 minutes 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lapras kinda hard. Good def 
David Busby  ----->  Eh idk if I can make that and still do vape in time
David Busby  ----->  I will help y’all do one today if there’s one tho
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I would say get an extra phone and use my account but I'm pretty far awau
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Away
Blaine, E  ----->  Thanks! 
Worst case, I trade him one later..
Blaine, E  ----->  As long as he keeps this account and doesnt start a 3rd alt 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I have spare if he wants
Blaine, E  ----->  My no high speed isn't loading the pictures but imma assume its pages of lapras...
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yep
Ian Fraser  ----->  More Lapras that anyone ever needs 100%
David Busby  ----->  If sabis pushing vape back we can try lapras 
David Busby  ----->  Also how you live with only 6 spots
David Busby  ----->  Ok alpha lied to me wheres lapras 
Blaine, E  ----->  Well I took us in the wrong direction...so maybe the next one if possible
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He can take his pick. I think all need re roll except nessie. She OG
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Is anyone still interested in re-rolling beldums?  
Ian Fraser  ----->  Me. But I won't be around till the 8th
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t mind holding on to them if there’s interest. If not, I would transfer them for double candy. 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So has anyone in Auburn soloed a ttar yet? (I'm looking at you @David Busby )
Darren May  ----->  I duoed it with Snookems. Does that count?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha how much time was left? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, are these boxes worth getting a second one if we got the coins? The last few were BAD
Darren May  ----->  30ish seconds but I made a mistake by not using all Machamps I think. We were coming back from a heatran raid, it was rainy in game and people were saying kyogre was better than groudon with weather boost. I assumed it would be the same for ttar but experience says otherwise 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes ttar is double weak to fighting so I would def say all champ is best
Darren May  ----->  So is it true then that weather boosted kyogre is better than groudon for heatran?
Sam Kawell  ----->  Groudon is still around 2% better even in the rain
Darren May  ----->  Thanks that makes sense to me but I’m not the math guy. There were 15 people in that raid so it didn’t matter
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I guess I should ask the poke financial expert, @David Busby how many beers do I have to have b4 I'm comfortable buying another box? 


Blaine, E  ----->  Do it *insert emperor palpatine GIF here*
Keaton Rhea  ----->  ... But what if a better one comes along? I value raid passes the most so what if next one has more than 14?
Blaine, E  ----->  How many coins do you currently have?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Not enough, obviously 🙄 
Blaine, E  ----->  I'm sure he has enough to minimally buy this box twice 🙄 stop being frugal lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just a few... 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  See. Not enough. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Of course, I don’t have a spending problem. Just an income problem. 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes Joe is right. Emily always wrong
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just stating the facts 
Ian Fraser  ----->  If you care about anything besides raid passes this one. If you only care about raid passes you could hold one but it might be another year before we get a good one. If ever. 
Blaine, E  ----->  Wait. Why am I always wrong? 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Mostly because ashkutually that's Chancellor Palpatine in that gif @Blaine, E 
Ian Fraser  ----->  🧐🤓
Keaton Rhea  ----->  What Ian said
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Wrong
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yes exactly that 
Blaine, E  ----->  Excuuuuuse me. He has 3 names 🙄 he was always darth Sidious so I'm going to go with that
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Ur excused. Now move along
Blaine, E  ----->  Rude 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Excuse me, four names. 
Blaine, E  ----->  I cant load any gifs right now!
Blaine, E  ----->  Oh jk it loaded 😂
Blaine, E  ----->  I need your hotspot Keaton!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  The best hot spot
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Did I get the Nashville egg from you?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yes 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Thank you 😁
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yay!  I’m happy for you!
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Thank you! I’ve only hatched 3 7ks this event...but one was this and I got a Santa hat pichu too.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I got a Santa hat pichu also! 
Taylor Pruitt  ----->  Nice! Lucky us 👍🏼
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Thanks for all the sinnoh stones Emily! I got all of those from the past few days of battles. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, don't look at that time stamp... I was already up for an hr b4 that... 
Blaine, E  ----->  Glad you got so many!
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Good morning and merry Christmas eve to everyone.  A sad thing happened.....i didn't open my game for 2 days. Worst streek ever lol. Still pulled a triple b2b2b t5 on the way to work today to make up for it. @Keaton Rhea Cindy said she needed the exp 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  She doesn't need anymore exp! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I need that exp
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Don't worry tho Cindy. I'm about to go a few days without any stops or spawns. Plenty of time to catch up
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And prob a week b4 another raid
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ Did huckleberry happen to open my gift while he was doing that b2b2b?  Keaton caught up with me in besties and that’s a problem for me 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  No I didn't want to wake you that early lol.
David Busby  ----->  I think we’re all at 45 best rn 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  I feel left out when you say we all lol. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost can you run an egg for huckleberry?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Don’t know how I missed this @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ but I can pop an egg whenever
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ Headed to church in a few minutes. Should be available again around 7:30. 
Blaine, E  ----->  @Matt Inger I think the gift I sent will make us ultra. Let me know when you want to open please!
Blaine, E  ----->  ...or not 😂
Matt Inger  ----->  😁 sorry my bad!  
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Merry Christmas everyone! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Merry Christmas!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Happy Holidays, everyone!
Matt Inger  ----->  Merry Christmas!! 🎄
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Santa brought me an eevee roll call shirt. Now if only niantic would give us some of these eevolutions...

David Busby  ----->  I don’t even know why I want a stupid chingling or mantyke
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Bc mantykes are soooo cute
Matt Inger  ----->  @Sam Kawell I sent one from my son’s account and realized we weren’t friends on my main.  Please add 0393 2693 3055
Sam Kawell  ----->  I could have sworn we were friends. That's so weird!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ I have an egg going until 4 if huckleberry would like to open my gift. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Like my 5th 7km egg.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And 7th....

Ian Fraser  ----->  I'm at 42 7km I think. 
David Busby  ----->  Figured one of those would get it lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If it makes u feel any better, all I wanted was the mantyke. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But I'm sure u guys will get urs soon! 
David Busby  ----->  Y’all don’t wanna know what Jan and feb research rewards are
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Omg.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Shoot me now
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Light lunch today 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Pretty sure they're getting super lazy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  *they were already lazy
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I just got three excellents in a row and none of them registered towards my quests 😤
David Busby  ----->  If you get desperate let me know lol 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I don't got that hambot throws, but I can help as well! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Thanks. I haven’t really been trying but a high cp carnivine spawned in my kitchen so I gave it a shot. I should have known it was too good to be true since carnivines are usually easy to catch. 
Cindy R  ----->  Hi guys!!!  I've missed yall! Hope you had a Merry Christmas!!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hope you had a good Christmas too Cindy! 
Cindy R  ----->  My tired is tired, but it was good! 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Have you guys gotten all moved in @Cindy R ?
Blaine, E  ----->  @David Busby up to you! We are heading there now to try. If I remember how to get there 🤔
David Busby  ----->  Go all the way down samford and look to your left
David Busby  ----->  You hit shug you went too far turn around and take first right 
David Busby  ----->  Errr might be second right if you have to turn around 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Apparently, I am the dog whisper at home! 
David Busby  ----->  Forgot to post in here 😊
Cindy R  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost we are down to just a few things in the garage to get over here. 

We are started to get settled..kitchen, dining room, are done..almost done with the living room and guest bedroom. Our list seems never ending though LOL
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’ll be such a relief when you’re done!
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I’ll know those feelings soon when we start moving to our new place @Cindy R my honey-do list grows exponentially every day. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Wtf. Is Taylor being serious?
David Busby  ----->  He’s drunk
David Busby  ----->  As per usual
David Busby  ----->  @Phil Pearson I hate to bring you into this but yea I feel it needs to be done
Ian Fraser  ----->  Idk. I'll ask about meeting up with him tomorrow when I'm back and then I'll see if I just tag Phil lol. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yeah. You might want to try when he’s not drunk
Ian Fraser  ----->  Nah it can wait. I'm not back till the 8th anyway. Would have preferred asking one of your but I'm bff with almost everyone in here
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Haven’t seen him like this in a while. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Why does it have to be an ultra?
David Busby  ----->  If you want you could add df3 and work with him on friendship but he’s a terrible friend
David Busby  ----->  He’s trying to get under 1500 cp
Ian Fraser  ----->  Cause I need to tank the Cress cp and I only have a 4% chance with bff but a 19% chance with Ultra 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Anybody want to battle?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Between Jr (if Jr has a few left) maybe Daniel? I should be able to get it. I hope. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Oh we can make something happen lol. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  It’s not Mary Poppins we’re seeing @Blaine, E it’s The Sound of Music. 😂
Blaine, E  ----->  😂 slightly different. Still let me know if its good!
Blaine, E  ----->  Chris and I were able to duo a ttar 😁 - it definitely is a lot easier
Ian Fraser  ----->  ... You've never seen the Sound of Music? 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I bet me and Kaitlin could do it then for sure!  
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I have seen the Sound of Music. We are seeing the live performance at Alabama Shakespeare Festival. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Not you @Elizabeth Kidd Yost, Blaine 😅
Ian Fraser  ----->  But that sounds like fun! 
Blaine, E  ----->  Oh I have seen it too...I meant the live performance!
Blaine, E  ----->  Ttar at boykin with cloudy weather. That's what you wanted right @David Busby ?
David Busby  ----->  Rip nap life got me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Dang it. I wish I was in AU for that ttar. I would of woke up from a nap haha
Blaine, E  ----->  Is that for a solo attempt?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @David Busby T4 hatches at ag park in 3
David Busby  ----->  Yea I just saw that
David Busby  ----->  Marowak 🙄
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Too bad
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Blaine, E yes it was for a solo attempt. Gotta 1v1 a ttar haha
Blaine, E  ----->  Thanks
Sam Kawell  ----->  Could I have some more gifts please!
Sam Kawell  ----->  You guys are the best
Sam Kawell  ----->  All my cleffas and elekids thank you
Ian Fraser  ----->  Bet mine will be a non shiny Azurill 🙃
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @David Busby cloudy ttar at Sam Harris. Just hatched
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ I’ve got an egg out until 12:30 if huckleberry would like to open my gift 😁
David Busby  ----->  Ughhh I’m at work til 3
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Sorry 😐 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  F
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Damn I only had time for two attempts and it's definitely possible. I was dropping the last DP as time expired that would of KO'd it
David Busby  ----->  Empty lobby trick?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I did that. Had full time. Just needed to have his crunch line up better
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I only had 1 wasted DP on second try. First one was awful with first 3 all being KO'd too fast. He chained off 4 crunch in a row
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'll have to try again! 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Yaassssss! Are any of you in new Jersey?
Ian Fraser  ----->  ..... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  ..... 
Ian Fraser  ----->  W
Ian Fraser  ----->  T
Ian Fraser  ----->  F
Sam Kawell  ----->  Was that from you lol?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Yep I'm in NJ with Catie's family. Apparently my streak of always giving better than I get extends to eggs as well as trading 😂
Sam Kawell  ----->  Haha, well thanks. I just sent you one and maybe I can return the luck
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Ian Fraser i sent u one! Hope it's good and not a meowth lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ Are me and huckleberry ever going to be besties? 😊
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost no! No more for u
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  😢
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m even besties with Sabi
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Staaaaphhh
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost im sending my best hunting dog over to go kill ur frands list. Put ur phone in a bowl: otherwise, she won't know to eat it! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  ;*
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I might need to change my password. You boys are starting to worry me
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol I've never done any thing wrong. U can ask Emily. I tell her I did bad things but that is just to scare her
David Busby  ----->  I’m super tempted to rename top screen manta was here
David Busby  ----->  Power up every orange Pokémon 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  ... But this frands list.... Hmmm
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes! David got it
Blaine, E  ----->  You are all bark, no bite
David Busby  ----->  He sure does bark a lot tho
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I trust you @Keaton Rhea Not sure about @David Busby though 
David Busby  ----->  Time for a shock collar 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Woof woof
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I bite like princess 
Blaine, E  ----->  😻
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Or at least a muzzle
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I mean I can get pretty aggressive like them.... 
Blaine, E  ----->  The mental image alone is amusing @Joseph Spalding 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  :/
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also, f this rain. Running my rib roast 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And BBQ table and smoker
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Nooooooooooooo
Joseph Spalding  ----->  We ended up doing fireworks early due to the incoming rain. It’s still dry here. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->   My wood chips r soaked :(
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yum!  Keven is smoking ribs tomorrow 
Blaine, E  ----->  Looks good to me 🤷‍♀️
David Busby  ----->  Yea I’ll be there shortly
David Busby  ----->  I’ll eat with the puppers if I have to 😂
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm doing ribs later this week for In laws! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But me need it stop raining 
David Busby  ----->  *and David 
Blaine, E  ----->  And Blaine (will trade for beer)
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol I got foods. Not much beer
Blaine, E  ----->  I got no food. Tons of beer
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Haha I over cooked as usual 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Leftovers for days! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Prime rib coming up
Keaton Rhea  ----->  One serving.. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Dem greens and black eyed peas tho... 😋 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Less elegant, but should be tasty too!
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell mmmm
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Elegant does not define flavor 
David Busby  ----->  Here I am fucking making a microwave dinner. I feel like a peasant 
Cindy R  ----->  We did little ceasers and alcohol..lol. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Alcohol is the key @Cindy R 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Darren May how is kroger? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just say hi brow
Darren May  ----->  It’s ok. Kids are at my parents so we can wander the store
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I think I might have a problem.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->   Man I hate cooking.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->   Brinner! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->   Emily OP
Blaine, E  ----->  He the real OP
David Busby  ----->  Yea idk why you dropping thicc in Sam harris 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I’m not in San harris
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I always think it’s a dm in here
Blaine, E  ----->  It wasn't intentional
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sorry @Elizabeth Kidd Yost our chaotic days off got me beat into casual mode. At one point Monday there were 10 worker vehicles here. 4 fence building, 3 plumber, 1 cable, 1 septic drainer and a truck with tracker to dig it up. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  No problem @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️! Sounds crazy! 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  Sad thing is the only peaceful thing I've done was started building our snoopy replica dog house for the pups.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  That’s awesome! I can’t wait to see pics!
David Busby  ----->  So is anyone else ridiculously pissed off about this hatchathon event
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Yuuuup. 43 eggs hatched since the reset on monday and nothing but munchies have my rage meter full. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Si
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I won't be participating 
Sam Kawell  ----->  Wow, that's dumb
David Busby  ----->  58 eggs since Monday
David Busby  ----->  I’m just triggering myself even more
Sam Kawell  ----->  My causal self has done 24 since Monday
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm very peeved
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  At least I’ll get double dust for these eggs I just started. 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  48 7ks since monday...
Sam Kawell  ----->  But my wife is the best
Sam Kawell  ----->  She traded me her heatran she just got
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Aw snap
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Lol I've hatched 7 eggs since mon 
David Busby  ----->  Wonder if you can solo a golem or rhydon like you can a ttar. Cause apparently those are the new t4s
David Busby  ----->  And they have double weaknesses
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Might take an army of vena to do it. Not checked anything yet tho 
David Busby  ----->  Vena or ogre?
David Busby  ----->  I figured ogres attack stat and bulk would win out. I’ve got two ogres at 40 and one at 36 I could finish
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hmm didn't think about ogre
David Busby  ----->  Your website said level 40 ogre in rainy takes .97 trainers
Sam Kawell  ----->  They should both be in sunny and rainy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Possible then! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  2 bar is prob more reliable 
David Busby  ----->  Golem defense is higher so that’ll be harder 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I really feel almost all 1 bar moves need a 10 to 20% dmg buff. They are useless in PvP and outclassed in raids by 2 bar. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Even SB needs a buff. It will do worse than FP in almost every situation. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Cress is supposed to be top tier with double single bar moves. Think that might be on the few expceptions tho. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's prob more bc its a brick house. If it had 2 bar moves of same type, then that would definitely be better 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Balance in this game is utter shit. A monkey could roll some dice better than Niantic plans
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It takes yrs to truly balance a game. The only other game I play, KF2, is finally in a very balanced state. 9/10 classes are viable. Very few weapons are hot garbage. It took 100s of balance changes, plus rebaalances when new guns are added. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Niantic has done, what two changes? 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Maybe 3 if u count the move changes as a separate one
David Busby  ----->  Keaton on the salt train now I love it 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I'm just agitated by this rain. I'm trying to BBQ and I've gotta run outside all the time to get water off my tent and keep smoker safe
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But at the same time, I think what I said was very true
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  You need a covered porch for the smoker 😉
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I hate this house.... 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  We will likely be buying next one and BBQ spots will be a factor
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  When we bought our house we told the realtor we needed a room big enough for a grand piano and a fenced in backyard for a dog - we didn’t have either 😂
David Busby  ----->  Rhydon at arch with rs eq and it’s raining...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  But what Carroll wants will matter more. I don't need much space but we had already out grown this house a few months after moving jn
David Busby  ----->  Anyone wanna back me up if I fail lol
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Do u have spare device? I'll give u Jr's login lol
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I would if I could David
Keaton Rhea  ----->  He has a free pass
David Busby  ----->  Unfortunately no cause I’d just use df3
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I can't leave now. I'm babysitting a tent. Sorry! 
David Busby  ----->  No worries I’m not even gonna bother 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  If ur chomping at the bit, u can come get my old phone for jr. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Just let me know
Blaine, E  ----->  ...boxes changed?? 😭😭
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Yep. Lots of incubators for the hatchithon! Can’t wait 😒
Keaton Rhea  ----->  It's awful. 
Blaine, E  ----->  I thought I had more time...
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yeah rip jr saving coins for the box. :(
Blaine, E  ----->  So do I want alolan eggs anymore? Do they still give the new babies?
Ian Fraser  ----->  Probably. Dunno if rate is changed tho. Honestly I would just wait for a rate shakeup. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Rate is trash. Gimme that baby Manta 
Blaine, E  ----->  This is alolan vulpix all over again 🤦‍♀️ 
Blaine, E  ----->  Chris got one @Keaton Rhea 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Chris is OP 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Blaine is trash. Just saying 
Blaine, E  ----->  ...
Darren May  ----->  Anyone know if the Edgar b Carter educational amphitheater stop is reachable by car?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t even know where that is
Darren May  ----->  Saw it on alpha. It has an anorith quest. It is off of Alabama street (west of bee lab/shug Jordan) but is way off the road
Darren May  ----->  Actually alpha is missing a street. It is off of Pratt-carden drive.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I don’t know but there are a couple others that you should be able to teach no problem. The village post office on wAr eAgle way is one
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  And this one. 
Darren May  ----->  Ooo didn’t see that one 
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I will be grabbing that bad boy
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Hangry
David Busby  ----->  I bet keaton treats those dogs better than my parents treat me
David Busby  ----->  And I’m going to the Bahamas in a week
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Before I had kids, my dog was my baby. Our poor dog now doesn’t even have a clue how good he could’ve had it. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  TIL, David wants to be my dog. Space in princess crate! Just saying 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  And yes, Elizabeth. We have kids planned but not now. Too poor
Keaton Rhea  ----->  My dogs r definitely not spoiled though. They work for everything 
David Busby  ----->  Do I get served mantas bbq while in crate? And can I still be taken to raids and pogo in general?
David Busby  ----->  Cause princess looks like she knows how to snuggle
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I'll put BBQ ribs in ur bowl
Darren May  ----->  Is it bad form to ask for an ex-raid invite and for someone to do the raid for you?
Cindy R  ----->  @ Darren I think I have one for Felton I can send, but we are not doing it.
Cindy R  ----->  Sent it incase you can use it.
Darren May  ----->  Thanks!
Darren May  ----->  Ok step 2. @David Busby Are you doing Felton?
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  He is and so am I. Surely between the two of us we can get it done for you. 
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  If anyone else needs a pass let me know. I can send one from mine and huckleberry 
Darren May  ----->  @Elizabeth Kidd Yost Cool. He already has me login info so I started with him. Just let me know if I need to send it to you.
David Busby  ----->  Yep just someone remind me I’m doing it lol
Joseph Spalding  ----->  I may be in Atlanta today, sooooooo...
David Busby  ----->  Which one you got?
Joseph Spalding  ----->  Felton little 
David Busby  ----->  Word so I’m doing Felton for joe and Darren. Anyone else not able to make it?
Matt Inger  ----->  @David Busby That’d be cool if you don’t mind.  I’ll send you a DM
Darren May  ----->  Thanks @David Busby! Were you nervous catching this bad boi?
David Busby  ----->  Nope lol. You hit best with aceberehill btw but it was his fault lol
Darren May  ----->  No problem. I’m low on lucky eggs anyway 
Sam Kawell  ----->  So don't hate me. 2/3 7k eggs......
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Casual bonus?
Matt Inger  ----->  Thanks! @David Busby 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think Joe’s was 1807. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell dat togapi gonna be lit for PvP! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Togepi. Stupid autocarrot
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I will say them candies make me sad tho
Joseph Spalding  ----->  It was 1807 and worse than matts. Go figure. lol @Elizabeth Kidd Yost 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Better than mine 😂
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  So for me tyrogue is the new stinking tripinch. 5 of the last 12 7ks.
Ian Fraser  ----->  Hitmontop and Chan not too bad in pvp tho
Blaine, E  ----->  well I am always right so...there's that �
Blaine, E  ----->  NO! wrong groupme. I realize I am not always right! Ignore!
Ian Fraser  ----->  Are you tho? 
Blaine, E  ----->  this is why I can't groupme on my computer -_-
Blaine, E  ----->  -_- thanks friend
Blaine, E  ----->  Good quality GIF though 👌
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️ I’ve got an egg on til 4:30 if huckleberry would like to open my gift now 😊
Daniel R🔹️dos 40🔹️  ----->  One of these days it will happen @Elizabeth Kidd Yost lol. We're still moving stuff around, working on plumbing and fencing and everything. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  @David Busby 
Darren May  ----->  @Blaine, E @David Busby could y’all wait on me at Felton? Trying to herd my children into the van 
Blaine, E  ----->  I can @Darren May 
Ian Fraser  ----->  https://youtu.be/m_MaJDK3VNE
Ian Fraser  ----->  @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  Parenthood is fun bc you can have what you think are sure fire great ideas, eg “hey lets go to Felton little and y’all can play on the playground” and each child will respond like you told them you were canceling Christmas 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Ian Fraser omg that is the best video I've ever seen in my life. So glad you enjoy that saying too. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I've said that to some of my lab mates or undergrads I work with and they flat out have never heard it. Makes me feel old. 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Herding cats? I didn't think it was that uncommon 😅 Glad you enjoyed! 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  I didn't either. Mom said it all the time trying to get me and my brother ready. Maybe I'm just with dumb dumbs
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Also. I just watched it for like the 5th time. Still laughing 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Something so small making me the happiest I've been in a while
Ian Fraser  ----->  I can't remember when I first saw it but I think it was during a super bowl a good while ago. I just remember my parents absolutely dying laughing at it, so much so that I still remember it today 😂
Blaine, E  ----->  I have never seen that video before, but I have found my new profession
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Kat lady herder
Blaine, E  ----->  Like I am herdering actual cat ladies 🤔 that does not seem as appealing 
Ian Fraser  ----->  Can't be harder than herding actual cats.. Right? 
Blaine, E  ----->  We are a hard breed to control 🤷‍♀️
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Yes I know. So difficult 
Ian Fraser  ----->  I know we discussed this a long long time ago but McGuire Air Force Base has stops, gyms, and apparently spawns
Darren May  ----->  I just hatched a drifloon from a 10k. Wtf?!
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Not cool
Ian Fraser  ----->  https://thesilphroad.com/egg-distances
Darren May  ----->  @Ian Fraser But why though?
Ian Fraser  ----->  🤷‍♂️ Niantic gonna Niantic, I guess. Their decisions lately with eggs have been questionable lately. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  They have always been questionable. 5km eggs have never had anything good in them. A few decent things like Mach and clefairy in 2km + starters but it's still all useless. 99% of the hatch pool is utter trash
Darren May  ----->  When you see someone coordinating ultra friends when they didn’t coordinate best friends with you.
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  Some people see that you’re level 40 and think you don’t care. 
Darren May  ----->  I don’t really but I would appreciate the courtesy!
Darren May  ----->  Very upset in my gif/meme skills. There is a part in Harry Potter iv where Voldemort says something along the lines of “cmon Harry the formalities must be observed” but I can’t find it
Ian Fraser  ----->  Best I can do on the go @Darren May 
Darren May  ----->  That’s it. Changing to niceties makes all the difference 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  We just watched that the other night so I knew exactly what you were talking about. 
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  I think having more best friends than @David Busby is more important to me than the extra xp 😜
David Busby  ----->  Whatever can you solo a rhydon? 😘
Elizabeth Kidd Yost  ----->  If I cared to throw all my dust and rares into kyogre and Gary I could but I’m not going to. 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Jr OP 
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Main ain't bad either 
Sam Kawell  ----->  I can really get behind this whole casual bonus thing
Sam Kawell  ----->  I'm up to 3 munchlax, 1 budew, and 1 shiny Togepi in around 40 7k eggs
Keaton Rhea  ----->  Sam OP. I now see jr as shit. Me as bad. Sam OP
Sam Kawell  ----->  On a completely unrelated note, may I have more eggs?
Keaton Rhea  ----->  @Sam Kawell i only could send one bc Jr already sent. Sorry!
